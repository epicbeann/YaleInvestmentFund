2020 Update on Climate Change

February 20, 2020

To:       The Yale Community 

From:   David F. Swensen, Chief Investment Officer

Climate change poses a grave threat to human existence and society must transition to cleaner energy sources.  This is a formidable task that requires swift and dramatic action on a global scale.  The solution involves a combination of government policy, technological innovation and changes in individual behavior.

As a premier research institution, Yale will have its greatest impact by doing what it does best: research, scholarship and education. With respect to its substantial operations, the University is committed to reduce its own carbon footprint and to encourage environmental stewardship among the tens of thousands of individuals within its community. 

Yaleâ€™s Endowment provides critical support for all of the Universityâ€™s endeavors.  In fact, well more than half of the budget for the Faculty of Arts and Sciences comes from Endowment distributions.  Prudent stewardship of the Endowment underpins substantial, stable financial support both for todayâ€™s scholars and for generations of scholars to come.

In 2014, I wrote to Yaleâ€™s active external investment managers, outlining Yaleâ€™s investment policy regarding climate change.  In 2016, I updated the Yale community on the impact of Yaleâ€™s policies.  Today, I am writing to provide a further update.

Yaleâ€™s Role as an Institutional Investor

In 2014, the Yale Investments Office developed a plan to address climate change risks in the Endowment portfolio.  The plan has been implemented through Yaleâ€™s external managers, who collectively are responsible for managing nearly all of the Universityâ€™s Endowment assets.  Engagement with Yaleâ€™s managers is a powerful tool through which the University influences the character of the Endowment.  Yaleâ€™s managers make critical decisions about what investments are selected for Yaleâ€™s portfolio and what issues are raised with company management teams.  Given the nature of Yaleâ€™s investment strategy, direct dialogue with its managers is the most effective means of addressing climate change risks in the portfolio. [1]    

Yaleâ€™s investment policy regarding climate change asks that external managers: 

Assess:

the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of prospective investments

the direct costs of the consequences of climate change on expected returns

the financial costs of policies (such as a carbon tax) aimed at reducing GHG emissions on expected returns 

Discuss with company managements:

the financial risks of climate change

the financial implications of prospective, well-crafted government policies to reduce GHG emissions

Encourage company managements:

to mitigate financial risks and increase financial returns by reducing GHG emissions

Avoid: 

companies that refuse to acknowledge the social and financial costs of climate change and that fail to take economically sensible steps to reduce GHG emissions

Members of my staff speak with each manager about Yaleâ€™s policies and how they apply to the managerâ€™s portfolio.  This process communicates Yaleâ€™s position in a clear and consistent manner and gives Yale and the manager an opportunity to discuss the principles underpinning Yaleâ€™s policies.  Investments Office staff regularly engage managers regarding the risks associated with climate change.

The Impact of Yaleâ€™s Approach

As I noted in 2016, when Investments Office staff first discussed my letter with Yaleâ€™s active investment managers, nearly all supported the approach described in the letter and appreciated the admonition to consider the economic impact of climate change on investments.  I am pleased to report that the response to Yaleâ€™s policy continues to be positive and confirms ongoing alignment between Yale and its external managers on how to think about the risks of climate change.  

Climate change risks regularly arise in the ordinary course of discussions between Yale staff and external managers.  For example, my colleagues have discussed with managers: the carbon footprint of various sources of power; the fuel efficiency of companiesâ€™ fleets; the energy efficiency of buildings that managers are developing, renovating or leasing up; and the impact of potential sea level rise on a developerâ€™s land bank.  In a specific example, a manager contemplated making an investment in a services provider to the oil sands industry and reached out to discuss the potential investment because of my letter.  My colleagues reiterated Yaleâ€™s concerns about climate change risks and questioned whether this investment would make sense after taking into account climate change externalities.  The manager ultimately decided not to make the investment.   

Our managers take a variety of approaches to addressing climate change issues.  For example, managers have conducted environmental, social and governance (ESG) screens, employed state-of-the-art energy audits and developed their own carbon pricing analytics. [2]  They may go above and beyond common sustainability certifications, leading to less environmental impact. 

One private equity manager conducts an ESG survey of each portfolio company at an early stage of acquisition to take inventory of material issues.  Together, the manager and the company come up with a way to measure ESG progress on a regular basis.  This process has resulted in numerous management-led initiatives with regard to carbon footprints of various companies, including avoiding packaging waste, deploying energy management systems and increasing recycling volume.    

A real estate manager developed a property that exceeds the standards set forth by the U.S. Green Building Council, resulting in 25% reduced energy use and 75% reduced water usage.  This was achieved through thoughtful design and construction, including electrochromatic glass that is programmed to adjust shading to the path of the sun and a rain water capture system; the manager also built a multi-layer water filtration system to clean polluted runoff from a nearby highly trafficked roadway, resulting in over 400,000 gallons per year of water flowing into the watershed that is clean enough to drink.

For many managers, Yale is often one of the more significant investment partners, placing the University in a strong position to influence a manager to incorporate the risks of climate change into investment decisions.  A typical reaction from a manager is that Yaleâ€™s policy is consistent with the firmâ€™s values, but the manager appreciates Yaleâ€™s viewpoint and strives to be more explicit in the implementation of the Universityâ€™s principles.  Following are a few quotes from our managers:

â€œThe Yale letter on climate change continues to be a touchstone that we measure our actions against. Importantly, it has been a source of inspiration for our effort to deepen engagement with our portfolio companies. This has not only taken the form of tangible action, where we formally monitor the ESG issues that matter to our companiesâ€™ success, but also symbolic leadership, where, like the letter did for us, we can signal to our companies that environmental stewardship is a priority.â€ 

â€œShaped by our founderâ€™s passion and concern for the environment, our company has a longstanding commitment to sustainability. Analyzing every possibility to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to slow climate change while maximizing value for our investors remains at the forefront of our efforts. We remain focused on engaging with our employees, tenants, stakeholders and the communities in which we operate to advance our sustainability initiatives. To hear in clear and honest terms from Yale that we are all on the same page was liberating and inspirational, and energizes the efforts of our company to further our efforts.â€  

â€œThank you so much for your letter detailing in a very thoughtful and sophisticated way Yaleâ€™s thinking on climate change and the ethical and investment implications that flow from it.  Since this is obviously an issue of deep importance to Yale and you were so gracious to ask for comments, on behalf of my colleagues, I am grateful for the opportunity to respond.  Having circulated your letter beforehand, we gathered this week for an all-hands discussion (we will have a follow-on meeting next week to agree and move ahead on the implementation details), and to the person, as individuals and investors, we support Yaleâ€™s policy 100%.  We believe Yaleâ€™s policy will help us invest better, that it will support us in serving the needs of a planet at risk from climate change AND driving higher returns for Yale and its educational mission.â€ 

Even as the world transitions to clean energy (which it must), in the near term we will rely on some significant measure of fossil fuels; thus, how fossil fuel companies behave will make a difference. [3]  Yaleâ€™s external managers understand the need to minimize emissions in producing oil and gas.  It might be helpful to highlight one managerâ€™s example.  Although we cannot describe in full detail the managerâ€™s ESG processes, the manager is willing to let us share that it conducts a two-stage ESG pre-investment screening process, which includes GHG calculations.  Once a company is acquired, the manager trains and works closely with the companyâ€™s board on ESG issues, requiring quarterly reporting; furthermore, it is currently in the process of implementing GHG accounting in an effort to reduce each companyâ€™s carbon footprint.  Through a combination of operational improvements, electrification, wind power, carbon capture and storage, and advancing other technological solutions, this manager seeks to reduce the overall carbon intensity of its portfolio, which is already much lower than the worldâ€™s average for oil production.  This manager had the following to say to Yale:    

â€œThe oil and gas industry must have two thoughts in mind - embracing the paramount energy transition, while at the same time producing oil and gas with the lowest possible emissions. For us, it is imperative that the companies we invest in are part of the solution and not part of the problem, as this will be their license to operate and futureproofs our investments.  Climate considerations are a prerequisite for both our selection of new investments and our work with the current portfolio.  In this, we believe we are aligned with the approach of Yaleâ€™s Investment Office.â€ 

Yaleâ€™s Portfolio

The composition of Yaleâ€™s Endowment stems from many individual investment decisions made by a host of world-class external investment managers.  As these managers incorporate the full costs of climate change into investment choices and, in the cases of corporate investments, engage the managements of portfolio companies in discussions about addressing climate change, the risks associated with climate change are reduced.  The risk reduction may come from sales of offending investments, from avoiding offending investments or from influencing company managements to adopt climate-friendly policies.  The accumulation of investment decisions that incorporate the full costs of climate change leads to a shift in flows of capital towards less carbon-intensive investments and away from more carbon-intensive investments. 

As I mentioned in 2016, at the time we articulated our policy, a few freely tradable investments in our portfolio were inconsistent with the principles of my letter, namely holdings in thermal coal miners and oil sands producers, two of the industries that would suffer if regulation imposed the social cost of carbon emissions on producers.  Working with our external investment managers, we successfully exited three of those positions, as I reported at the time.  Subsequently, we identified two other public holdings, which have been liquidated.

Private investments take much longer to exit than public investments.  Since 2016, one thermal coal investment held by a private partnership has been fully liquidated.  Although the process has been slower than we would have liked, the good news is that the remaining thermal coal private investments are on the way out of the portfolio. [4]  

Since 2014, Yaleâ€™s exposure to thermal coal and oil sands has declined from roughly 0.24% of the Endowmentâ€™s market value to roughly 0.02% of the Endowmentâ€™s market value today.

Conclusion

Yaleâ€™s investment approach to climate change contributes to the broader societal goal of transitioning to clean energy.  Under Yaleâ€™s approach, which asks managers to incorporate the costs of carbon emissions in investment decisions, investments with large greenhouse gas footprints are disadvantaged relative to investments with small greenhouse gas footprints.  When taking into account the full costs of climate change, investment capital flows towards less carbon-intensive businesses and away from more carbon-intensive businesses.   

Yaleâ€™s investment policy regarding climate change reduces portfolio risk and supports our fiduciary responsibility â€“ to provide substantial, stable financial support for current and future scholars through the prudent management of Yaleâ€™s Endowment.  This support enables Yale to pursue its mission and to contribute to climate change solutions through its greatest areas of strength: research, scholarship and education.  I am grateful to the Yale community for its support and engagement on this important issue.

                                   

[1] In 2014, the Corporation Committee on Investor Responsibility (CCIR) adopted proxy voting guidelines regarding climate change.  In recent years Yale has held relatively few securities directly. When the University holds shares directly, Yale will vote for resolutions that support: disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, analyses of the impact of climate change on business activities, strategies designed to reduce the long-term impact on the global climate, and sound and effective governmental policies on climate change.   

[2] All examples of manager behavior in this letter are shared with manager consent.

[3] For example, there is a wide range of carbon intensity for oil and gas production from various causes, such as gas flaring, methane leaks and venting.  Thus, there is a need for oil and gas companies to manage their carbon footprint with respect to their operations, which may have a material environmental impact.  At least one recent study suggests that the total petroleum well-to-refinery GHG emissions in 2015 are estimated to be ~1.7 Gt CO2 equivalent, or approximately 5% of total 2015 global fuel combustion CO2 emissions.  See Masnadi, Mohammed, et. al. â€œGlobal carbon intensity of crude oil production.â€   Science, vol. 361, no. 6405, pp. 851-853, https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/361/6405/851.full.pdf.  Accessed 17 February 2020.  

[4] With respect to one firm that is no longer a manager in good standing with Yale, we took the unusual step of banding together with like-minded investors to vote against extending the terms of their partnerships in order to accelerate their liquidation of positions that do not meet Yaleâ€™s standards.  The majority of Yaleâ€™s non-compliant investments are held through these funds. 


Advisory Commity on Investor Responsibility

Committee History and Mission
Yale was one of the first institutions to address formally the ethical responsibilities of institutional investors. In 1969 Professors John Simon, James Tobin, William Brainard, and Charles Lindblom along with Yale graduate students Charles Powers and Jon Gunnemann conducted a seminar entitled â€œYaleâ€™s Investments,â€  which explored the ethical, economic, and legal implications of institutional investments. As a result of the seminar, Messrs. Simon, Powers, and Gunnemann wrote The Ethical Investor: Universities and Corporate Responsibility. Published in March 1972 by the Yale University Press, the book established criteria and procedures by which a university could respond to requests from members of its community to consider factors in addition to economic return when making investment decisions and exercising rights as shareholder.

The Yale Corporation adopted the guidelines outlined in The Ethical Investor in April 1972 and Yale became, according to The New York Times, â€œthe first major university to resolve this issue by abandoning the role of passive institutional investor.â€  The book subsequently served as a blueprint for the ethical policies of a number of universities.

In the 1972-3 academic year, as suggested in The Ethical Investor, Yale established the Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility (ACIR). The inaugural committee addressed social responsibility issues ranging from company investment in South Africa, to defense contracting, political lobbying and environmental safety. Later the Yale Corporation formed the Corporation Committee on Investor Responsibility (CCIR).

The CCIR is composed of Fellows of the Corporation. It recommends policy to the full Corporation and is charged with implementing approved policy. In discharging its responsibility, the CCIR is assisted by the ACIR. The ACIR is composed of two students (one undergraduate and one graduate), two alumni, two faculty, and two staff members. 


As a premier research institution, Yale will have its greatest impact by doing what it does best: research, scholarship and education. With respect to its substantial operations, the University is committed to reduce its own carbon footprint and to encourage environmental stewardship among the tens of thousands of individuals within its community.

Ethical Investing Policy
Overview
Yale was one of the first institutions to address formally the ethical responsibilities of
institutional investors. In 1969 Professors John Simon, James Tobin, William Brainard, and
Charles Lindblom along with Yale graduate students Charles Powers and Jon Gunnemann
conducted a seminar entitled â€œYaleâ€™s Investments,â€  which explored the ethical, economic, and
legal implications of institutional investments. As a result of the seminar, Simon, Powers, and
Gunnemann wrote The Ethical Investor: Universities and Corporate Responsibility. Published
in March 1972 by the Yale University Press, the book established criteria and procedures by
which a university could respond to requests from members of its community to consider factors
in addition to economic return when making investment decisions and exercising rights as a
shareholder. It remains the pioneering work in its field.
The Yale Corporation adopted the guidelines outlined in The Ethical Investor in April
1972, and Yale became, according to The New York Times, â€œthe first major university to resolve
this issue by abandoning the role of passive institutional investor.â€  The book subsequently
served as a blueprint for the ethical policies of a number of universities.
In the academic year following the publication of The Ethical Investor, Yale established
the Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility (ACIR). The inaugural committee addressed
social responsibility issues including U.S. corporate investment in South Africa, defense
contracting, political lobbying, and environmental safety. Later, the Yale Corporation formed
the Corporation Committee on Investor Responsibility (CCIR).
The CCIR is composed of Fellows of the Corporation. It recommends policy to the full
Corporation and is charged with implementing the approved policy. In discharging its
responsibility, the CCIR is assisted by the ACIR. The ACIR is composed of two students (one
undergraduate and one graduate), two alumni, two faculty, and two staff members. The ACIR
provides advice and performs the practical work of policy implementation for the CCIR. Two of
the ACIRâ€™s principal tasks are to advise the CCIR on the voting of corporate proxies dealing
with ethical issues and to engage directly with members of the Yale community who raise
concerns about Yale's ethical investment activities.
Past Actions Regarding Major Issues
South Africa
In 1978, the Yale Corporation adopted a policy on investing in South Africa.
Emphasizing Yaleâ€™s deeply held opposition to apartheid, the policy addressed the Universityâ€™s
belief that it had â€œan ethical duty to contribute to the process of peaceful changeâ€  in the country.
Recognizing that the most effective method of achieving enduring change was through active
participation, Yale initiated dialogue with each U.S. based company operating in South Africa in
which the University was a shareholder. The focus of these efforts was to promote
managementâ€™s adherence to the principles of fair and equitable employment practices and the
elimination of segregation.
To assess portfolio companiesâ€™ level of compliance with Yaleâ€™s ethical investing policy,
the University sent a ten-member delegation to South Africa in 1986. Comprised of Yale
Corporation fellows, faculty, administrators and students, the delegation visited U.S and South
African companies to assess their roles in the apartheid system. The delegation met with
representatives from three South African universities to discuss actions that might be undertaken
to improve and strengthen black education. The fact-finding mission allowed Yale to apply
more effective, constructive pressure to align corporate activity with ethical imperatives.
Through its efforts as a shareholder, Yale made significant progress in advancing its
message to corporations. In those situations in which it became apparent that a companyâ€™s
actions would continue to be incompatible with University policy, Yale sold its shares. From
1978 through 1994, Yale divested shares of 17 companies operating in South Africa,
representing a total market value of approximately $23 million. In February 1994, recognizing
the positive changes occurring in the country, the Yale Corporation lifted all investment
restrictions.
Tobacco
Throughout the 1990s, the Corporation thoroughly reviewed the holding of tobaccorelated stocks. As a result of the reviews, in 1994 the Corporation established guidelines on
voting of tobacco proxies. These instructions were supplemented in 1996, when the CCIR
directed the ACIR to vote in favor of well-constructed proxy resolutions that:
a) call upon tobacco companies to place health warnings about the dangers of
addiction, disease and death caused by smoking on all advertising and
promotional items for tobacco products distributed throughout the world;
b) request companies to cease advertising tobacco products to minors, including
all uses of the companyâ€™s brand names and associated symbols for sponsorships;
c) request tobacco companies to support enforcement mechanisms at all
governmental levels to prevent illegal sales of tobacco products to minors;
d) request tobacco companies to take actions designed to reduce the health risks
to minors;
e) call upon tobacco companies to report publicly accurate information relating to
the ingredients of their products that have probable adverse health effects.
The Corporation voting guidelines stem, in part, from an ACIR report that found the
possibility of social injury in the marketing and distribution of tobacco products, not in their
manufacture. As a result, the University chooses to engage tobacco companies in dialogue,
hoping to change objectionable policies and procedures.
Sudan
Beginning in 2003, the Government of Sudan and government-sponsored militias
engaged in human rights atrocities in the region of Darfur, Sudan. The U.S. government
determined that genocide had occurred and might be continuing. As the Sudanese government
relies heavily on oil revenues, oil companies operating in Sudan were viewed as providing
substantial assistance to the perpetrators of genocide and were therefore deemed complicit.
After conducting research with the assistance of the Yale Law School Allard K.
Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic, the ACIR found that providing instrumentalities
of genocide represented a grave social injury and recommended divestment from oil companies
operating in Sudan as well as from the general obligations of the Sudanese government. Based
on that recommendation, the Yale Corporation voted unanimously in February 2006 to put
certain oil and gas companies on the restricted list. As a result, Yale divested from one
company. The Sudan divestment policy remains in effect today and the ACIR continues to
monitor activities in Sudan and annually recommends updates to the restricted company list.
Climate Change
The CCIR and the Yale Investments Office took up the issue of climate change in 2014.
Believing that climate change is a grave threat to human welfare, the CCIR issued a public
statement on August 27, 2014, adopting new proxy voting guidelines for implementation by the
ACIR. Specifically, the guideline provides:
Yale will generally support reasonable and well-constructed shareholder
resolutions seeking company disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, analyses of
the impact of climate change on a companyâ€™s business activities, strategies
designed to reduce the companyâ€™s long-term impact on the global climate, and
company support of sound and effective governmental policies on climate change.
At the same time, the Chief Investment Officer sent a letter to all of Yaleâ€™s active
Endowment managers encouraging them to account properly for the internal and external costs
of greenhouse gas emissions and to avoid companies that refuse to acknowledge the social and
financial costs of climate change. In April 2016, the Chief Investment Officer updated the Yale
community on the positive influence of his letter, including sales of holdings deemed
inconsistent with the economic approach laid out by Yale.
Private Prisons
For several years, the ACIR looked into the operation of private prisons. In 2018, the
Corporation adopted proxy guidelines for issues relating to private prisons which were drafted by
the ACIR and endorsed by the CCIR:
Yale will support reasonable, and well-constructed shareholder resolutions related
to improvements in the corporate social responsibility of private prisons.
Examples of resolutions that would be supported in the future include those
seeking disclosure by private prison companies of their political contributions and
lobbying activities and the use of contracts with private prison companies that
contain incentives based on objective measures of performance such as lower
recidivism rates. Other resolutions that would be supported relate to efforts to
reduce prisoner rape and sexual abuse and efforts to reduce the high cost of phone
calls made by prisoners at private prisons. The University also would support
resolutions that request that the boards of directors of private prison companies
obtain independent assessments of their success in reducing violence, use of force
incidents, disciplinary and grievance systems, contraband, lockdowns and positive
drug tests. These examples are meant to be illustrative and not comprehensive as
it is not possible to anticipate precisely the full range of issues that might be
presented for shareholder consideration in the future.
Assault Weapon Retailers
In 2018, the Corporation adopted a policy regarding investment in assault weapon
retailers. Specifically, Yale will not invest in any retail outlets that market and sell assault
weapons to the general public. The ACIR determined that mass shootings cause incontrovertible
societal harm and retailers supplying assault weapons to the general public cause grave social
injury, a conclusion supported by the CCIR. In recommending the policy to the Corporation, the
CCIR gave special consideration to various factors raised by the ACIR, including: (1) the
distinction between manufacturers and retail distributors of assault weapons, since assault
weapons may be used for sanctioned purposes by the military and law enforcement, and (2) the
large number of shootings that occur at educational institutions, which is of particular relevance
to Yale as an institution of higher education. This policy applies to traditional retail distributors,
as well as promoters and dealers who organize and sell assault weapons at gun shows. 

Ethical Investing Policy
Overview
Yale was one of the first institutions to address formally the ethical responsibilities of
institutional investors. In 1969 Professors John Simon, James Tobin, William Brainard, and
Charles Lindblom along with Yale graduate students Charles Powers and Jon Gunnemann
conducted a seminar entitled â€œYaleâ€™s Investments,â€  which explored the ethical, economic, and
legal implications of institutional investments. As a result of the seminar, Simon, Powers, and
Gunnemann wrote The Ethical Investor: Universities and Corporate Responsibility. Published
in March 1972 by the Yale University Press, the book established criteria and procedures by
which a university could respond to requests from members of its community to consider factors
in addition to economic return when making investment decisions and exercising rights as a
shareholder. It remains the pioneering work in its field.
The Yale Corporation adopted the guidelines outlined in The Ethical Investor in April
1972, and Yale became, according to The New York Times, â€œthe first major university to resolve
this issue by abandoning the role of passive institutional investor.â€  The book subsequently
served as a blueprint for the ethical policies of a number of universities.
In the academic year following the publication of The Ethical Investor, Yale established
the Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility (ACIR). The inaugural committee addressed
social responsibility issues including U.S. corporate investment in South Africa, defense
contracting, political lobbying, and environmental safety. Later, the Yale Corporation formed
the Corporation Committee on Investor Responsibility (CCIR).
The CCIR is composed of Fellows of the Corporation. It recommends policy to the full
Corporation and is charged with implementing the approved policy. In discharging its
responsibility, the CCIR is assisted by the ACIR. The ACIR is composed of two students (one
undergraduate and one graduate), two alumni, two faculty, and two staff members. The ACIR
provides advice and performs the practical work of policy implementation for the CCIR. Two of
the ACIRâ€™s principal tasks are to advise the CCIR on the voting of corporate proxies dealing
with ethical issues and to engage directly with members of the Yale community who raise
concerns about Yale's ethical investment activities.
Past Actions Regarding Major Issues
South Africa
In 1978, the Yale Corporation adopted a policy on investing in South Africa.
Emphasizing Yaleâ€™s deeply held opposition to apartheid, the policy addressed the Universityâ€™s
belief that it had â€œan ethical duty to contribute to the process of peaceful changeâ€  in the country.
Recognizing that the most effective method of achieving enduring change was through active
participation, Yale initiated dialogue with each U.S. based company operating in South Africa in
which the University was a shareholder. The focus of these efforts was to promote
managementâ€™s adherence to the principles of fair and equitable employment practices and the
elimination of segregation.
To assess portfolio companiesâ€™ level of compliance with Yaleâ€™s ethical investing policy,
the University sent a ten-member delegation to South Africa in 1986. Comprised of Yale
Corporation fellows, faculty, administrators and students, the delegation visited U.S and South
African companies to assess their roles in the apartheid system. The delegation met with
representatives from three South African universities to discuss actions that might be undertaken
to improve and strengthen black education. The fact-finding mission allowed Yale to apply
more effective, constructive pressure to align corporate activity with ethical imperatives.
Through its efforts as a shareholder, Yale made significant progress in advancing its
message to corporations. In those situations in which it became apparent that a companyâ€™s
actions would continue to be incompatible with University policy, Yale sold its shares. From
1978 through 1994, Yale divested shares of 17 companies operating in South Africa,
representing a total market value of approximately $23 million. In February 1994, recognizing
the positive changes occurring in the country, the Yale Corporation lifted all investment
restrictions.
Tobacco
Throughout the 1990s, the Corporation thoroughly reviewed the holding of tobaccorelated stocks. As a result of the reviews, in 1994 the Corporation established guidelines on
voting of tobacco proxies. These instructions were supplemented in 1996, when the CCIR
directed the ACIR to vote in favor of well-constructed proxy resolutions that:
a) call upon tobacco companies to place health warnings about the dangers of
addiction, disease and death caused by smoking on all advertising and
promotional items for tobacco products distributed throughout the world;
b) request companies to cease advertising tobacco products to minors, including
all uses of the companyâ€™s brand names and associated symbols for sponsorships;
c) request tobacco companies to support enforcement mechanisms at all
governmental levels to prevent illegal sales of tobacco products to minors;
d) request tobacco companies to take actions designed to reduce the health risks
to minors;
e) call upon tobacco companies to report publicly accurate information relating to
the ingredients of their products that have probable adverse health effects.
The Corporation voting guidelines stem, in part, from an ACIR report that found the
possibility of social injury in the marketing and distribution of tobacco products, not in their
manufacture. As a result, the University chooses to engage tobacco companies in dialogue,
hoping to change objectionable policies and procedures.

engaged in human rights atrocities in the region of Darfur, Sudan. The U.S. government

of genocide represented a grave social injury and recommended divestment from oil companies
operating in Sudan as well as from the general obligations of the Sudanese government. Based
on that recommendation, the Yale Corporation voted unanimously in February 2006 to put
certain oil and gas companies on the restricted list. As a result, Yale divested from one
company. The Sudan divestment policy remains in effect today and the ACIR continues to
monitor activities in Sudan and annually recommends updates to the restricted company list.

The CCIR and the Yale Investments Office took up the issue of climate change in 2014.

as well as promoters and dealers who organize and sell assault weapons at gun shows. 


Puerto Rico
Overview
After decades of depressed economic activity and unsuccessful policy initiatives, Puerto
Ricoâ€™s debt levels rose to unsustainable levels, leading the Commonwealth to default on July 1,
2016. In September 2017 â€“ while Puerto Rico was in the midst of restructuring its finances â€“
Hurricane Maria caused widespread destruction and plunged the island into a severe
humanitarian and economic crisis.
As Puerto Ricoâ€™s plight grew, a coalition of activists directed their energy towards Puerto
Ricoâ€™s creditors â€“ in particular, hedge fund managers â€“ calling on them to divest or forgive
holdings of Puerto Rican debt. Campus groups at Yale, as well as other state and local
organizations, demanded that the University disclose all investments in Puerto Rican bonds,
cancel all those held by Yale, and fire investment managers who refuse to sell or forgive the debt.
These groups argue that bondholders are profiting from the crisis in Puerto Rico, or even
facilitating and furthering the crisis by extracting funds that would otherwise be directed to
recovery efforts.
Puerto Ricoâ€™s Debt
Puerto Ricoâ€™s financial troubles began well before Hurricane Maria. As early as
February 2014, the three bond credit rating agencies (S&P, Moodyâ€™s, and Fitch) downgraded
Puerto Ricoâ€™s debt to non-investment grade. At the time, Puerto Ricoâ€™s outstanding debt stood at
$70 billion, or nearly 70% of its GDP. By comparison, all 50 states have debt loads under 25%
of their respective GDPs.
Concerned that Puerto Rico was near default, the U.S. Congress passed the Puerto Rico
Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which President Obama
signed into law on June 30, 2016. Through PROMESA, Congress established a Fiscal Control
Board to oversee the debt restructuring process, aiming to â€œincrease the economyâ€™s resilience,
shore up public finances, support long-term durable growth, meet basic needs of the citizenry,
and restore opportunity for the people of Puerto Rico.â€  Under PROMESA's protection, Puerto
Rico officially defaulted on July 1, 2016 and commenced its restructuring.
As in any restructuring process, the creditors (in this case, the holders of Puerto Rico
bonds) understand that the debtorâ€™s (Puerto Ricoâ€™s) repayments are subject to adjustment so that
the debtor can emerge from bankruptcy in a sustainable fiscal position. According to Moodyâ€™s,
the amount originally owed to creditors of U.S. municipal bonds that defaulted between 1970
and 2016 was reduced by approximately 50% on a dollar-weighted basis during the bankruptcy
process, though the number varies widely depending on individual circumstances.1 Investors â€“
including Yaleâ€™s managers â€“ make informed judgments about the size and nature of the debt
reductions that will be required during the bankruptcy process. As outlined under PROMESA,
the Commonwealth is relieved from making interest and principal payments during the
restructuring. Payments will only resume after the process is complete, at what are expected to
 1 â€œUS Municipal Bond Defaults and Recoveries, 1970-2016â€ . Moodyâ€™s Investors Service. Published June 27, 2017.
be significantly diminished levels. At the end of the restructuring, if successful, Puerto Ricoâ€™s
debt will be sustainable over the long term and the Commonwealth will regain access to the
capital markets, both necessary steps for the islandâ€™s recovery and development.
ACIR
When this matter was raised in October 2017, it was referred to the ACIR. The ACIR
concluded in January 2018 that divestment from Puerto Rican debt is not warranted when an
investor is abiding by the applicable legal framework in a process in which the debtorâ€™s interests
are appropriately represented. PROMESA has placed the Commonwealth under federal court
protection to enable the suspension of payments and a workout with creditors. ACIR Chair
Jonathan Macey has pointed out that there have been no allegations of unethical debt collection
efforts or practices. He further noted that investment managers have fiduciary duties to their
investors that likely preclude them from unilaterally forgiving Puerto Ricoâ€™s payment obligations. 


Yale Ethical Investment Policy

Background -

Yale was one of the first institutions to address formally the ethical responsibilities of institutional investors. In 1969 Professors John Simon, James Tobin, William Brainard, and Charles Lindblom along with Yale graduate students Charles Powers and Jon Gunnemann conducted a seminar entitled "Yale's Investments," which explored the ethical, economic, and legal implications of institutional investments. Subsequently, Yale became, according to The New York Times, "the first major university to resolve this issue by abandoning the role of passive institutional investor."

Governance -
     
The Corporation Committee on Investor Responsibility (CCIR) considers and makes recommendations to the board of trustees on policy matters related to ethical investing. It is supported by the work of the Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility (ACIR), whose membership consists of Yale alumni, staff, faculty, and students. The Investments Office works with the ACIR and CCIR to implement policies adopted by the board of trustees.

Climate Change -
     
Climate change poses a grave threat to human existence and society must transition to cleaner energy sources. Recognizing that greenhouse gas emissions must be addressed, the Investments Office asks Yaleâ€™s Endowment managers to incorporate the costs of carbon emissions in investment decisions, and not to hold companies that refuse to acknowledge the social and financial costs of climate change and that fail to take economically sensible steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Under Yaleâ€™s approach, investments with large greenhouse gas footprints are disadvantaged relative to investments with small greenhouse gas footprints, and investment capital flows towards less carbon-intensive businesses and away from more carbon-intensive businesses.

Assault Weapons -

The Yale board of trustees has adopted a policy prohibiting investment in assault weapon retailers. Specifically, Yale will not invest in any retail outlets that market and sell assault weapons to the general public.  

Private Prisons -

Based on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Investor Responsibility, the Yale board of trustees adopted a policy making ineligible for investment CoreCivic and GEO Group, the two largest private prison companies, which dominate the industry. Read the boardâ€™s statement here. Yale does not have any investments in these two companies (or in any other private prison company), and this policy makes investment in these two companies impermissible.

Puerto Rico -

After decades of depressed economic activity and unsuccessful policy initiatives, Puerto Ricoâ€™s debt levels rose to unsustainable levels, leading the Commonwealth to default on July 1, 2016. In September 2017 â€“ while Puerto Rico was in the midst of restructuring its finances â€“ Hurricane Maria caused widespread destruction and plunged the island into a severe humanitarian and economic crisis. As Puerto Ricoâ€™s plight grew, a coalition of activists directed their energy towards Puerto Ricoâ€™s creditors â€“ in particular, hedge fund managers â€“ calling on them to divest or forgive holdings of Puerto Rican debt. When campus groups at Yale, as well as other state and local organizations, demanded that the University disclose all investments in Puerto Rican bonds, cancel all those held by Yale, and fire investment managers who refuse to sell or forgive the debt, the matter was referred to the ACIR. The ACIR concluded in January 2018 that divestment from Puerto Rican debt is not warranted when an investor is abiding by the applicable legal framework in a process in which the debtorâ€™s interests are appropriately represented.

Yale's Wind Farm -

Investments in wind can provide substantial economic returns to the University, while helping achieve sustainability goals. Beginning in 2007, Yale's managers, in conjunction with local wind power development firms, identified several sites with attractive capacity factors. The University's partners initiated development on a handful of sites. One site in particular, Record Hill Wind, is fully operational and was transferred from the Endowment to the University, and its management is now overseen by the Yale Office of Facilities.

Frequently Asked Questions -

Why doesnâ€™t Yale disclose its Endowment holdings? 

Yaleâ€™s longstanding policy is to preserve the confidentiality of its Endowment holdings, chiefly to honor its contractual obligations to third party investment managers. Yaleâ€™s investment partners are among the best in the world, and part of their competitive advantage (and therefore Yaleâ€™s) is that they are skilled at finding differentiated investments. Even when contractually permitted, the disclosure of Yaleâ€™s holdings would diminish that competitive advantage. In addition to maintaining the confidentiality of portfolio holdings, Yale seeks to maintain the confidentiality of its manager relationships. Because a key ingredient to Yaleâ€™s success is identifying the best investment managers, disclosing those relationships would likely increase competition for access to those managers. 

What does it mean for a company to show up on Yaleâ€™s Form 13-F? 

Although Yaleâ€™s Form 13-F lists securities over which Yale exercises investment discretion, it does not often (or even usually) mean that Yale has invested directly in that company. In most cases, a holding listed on Yaleâ€™s Form 13-F results from a liquidating distribution of that security from a third-party investment manager. Yale manages the Endowment primarily by hiring third-party investment managers with a differentiated advantage in finding investments. When a manager is ready to exit the position, they may choose to liquidate it for cash and distribute the cash to investors, or distribute those securities directly to investors. Yaleâ€™s general practice is to sell the securities it receives from its managers, subject to legal or other constraints. However, if the Form 13-F reference date falls between the date Yale receives its shares and the date Yale completes an orderly liquidation, a liquidating position will show up on Yaleâ€™s Form 13-F. A company can, therefore, show up multiple times on Yaleâ€™s Form 13-F when an orderly liquidation occurs in several distributions across multiple quarter-ends.Another reason a security could show up on Yaleâ€™s Form 13-F is if it was gifted to Yale. Similar to distributions from third-party investment managers, Yaleâ€™s general practice is to sell the gifted security, but timing could be such that Yale happens to hold it on the Form 13-F reference date.

What does it mean for an index fund or ETF to show up on Yaleâ€™s Form 13-F? Does Yaleâ€™s ethical investment policy preclude it from holding an index or ETF that might include a prohibited stock?

In addition to single-name securities, Yaleâ€™s Form 13-F may disclose holdings of index funds and/or exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Index funds are commonly held investment funds that have broadly-diversified portfolios that track specific benchmarks, such as the S&P 500. The sponsor of the index fund does not make active bets on the underlying securities; rather, the basket comprising the portfolio is based on a passively determined cross-section of the market the benchmark seeks to capture. Index funds and ETFs are employed by the Investments Office as a passive portfolio management tool to rebalance the Endowment and not as an active strategy. Unlike relationships with third-party investment managers, the Investments Office does not engage or interact with sponsors of index funds and ETFs. Any single position held by the Index or ETF typically would represent only a very small percentage of the Endowment. For example, Yaleâ€™s Form 13-F disclosed that Yale held an investment in the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) as of December 31, 2021. As of that date, Yaleâ€™s exposure to VWO represented 0.8% of the Endowmentâ€™s value, and the ETF comprised 5,306 different stocks in emerging markets around the world; thus, any single company represented a very small percentage of the Endowment. In addition, because rebalancing can occur as often as daily, Yaleâ€™s exposure to a given index fund could change frequently. Given the purpose and limited use of index funds and ETFs in the Endowment, and their importance as a portfolio management tool, Yaleâ€™s ethical investment policy does not prevent the holding of such funds.

How quickly can Yale dispose of an investment if it becomes the subject of a divestment policy? Yaleâ€™s third-party investment managers typically have full control over the investments they manage. As a result, if Yaleâ€™s divestment policy changes such that an existing holding becomes subject to divestment, divestment timing will depend on the relationship Yale has with the manager, including the pre-existing terms of its contractual agreements. In general, if Yale is in good standing with the manager and the underlying investment is a publicly-traded security, there is a high likelihood that the manager can eliminate that security from Yaleâ€™s account without much delay. However, if either of those conditions is absent or if the account is commingled with other investors, then Yale may be required to hold the investment for a longer period of time. The Investments Office diligently works to pursue the divestment until it is complete.

When I wrote the introduction to the first edition of Pioneering Portfolio Management in early 1999, Yale’s pathbreaking investment strategy had produced excellent results, both in absolute and relative terms, but had not yet been tested by adverse market conditions. In fact, Yale’s return for the ten years ending June 30, 1998 amounted to 15.5 percent per annum, more than three full percentage points short of the S&P 500’s 18.6 percent result. The endowment’s deficit relative to the then-highest-performing asset class of domestic equity caused naysayers to question the wisdom of undertaking the difficult task of creating a well-diversified equity-oriented portfolio.
The years following the first edition’s publication proved the worth of Yale’s innovative asset allocation. The continuation of the bull market in 1999 and early 2000 produced wonderful results for Yale, culminating in a 41.0 percent return for the year ending June 30, 2000, a result that trounced the average endowment return of 13.0 percent. Yet, the real test of Yale’s approach took place in 2001 and 2002 as the Internet bubble burst and marketable equities collapsed. Yale posted positive returns of 9.2 percent in 2001 and 0.7 percent in 2002, even as the average endowment reported deficits of 3.6 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. In short, equity orientation continued to drive Yale’s strong results, while diversification kicked in to preserve the university’s assets.
From a market perspective, the vantage point of early 2008 differs dramatically from that of early 1999. For the ten years ending June 30, 2007, Yale’s 17.8 percent return emphatically exceeded the S&P 500’s 7.1 percent. Twenty-year results tell a similar tale with Yale’s 15.6 percent trumping the S&P’s 10.8 percent. In fact, Yale’s conspicuous success attracted the attention of many investors, making the university’s strategy seem less radical and more sensible, less pioneering and more mainstream.
In spite of widespread imitation of Yale’s portfolio management philosophy, the university posted stunning returns relative to peers. For the year ended June 30, 2007, Yale reported a 28.0 percent return, which exceeded the results of all of the educational institutions that participated in the 2007 Cambridge Associates Annual Analysis of College and University Pool Returns. More significantly, Yale’s results led the pack for five-, ten-, and twenty-year periods. The university’s pioneering portfolio management works in theory and in practice.
The most important measure of endowment management success concerns the endowment’s ability to support Yale’s educational mission. When I arrived at Yale in 1985, the endowment contributed $45 million to the university’s budget, representing a century-low 10 percent of revenues. For Yale’s 2009 fiscal year, in large part as a result of extraordinary investment returns, the endowment will transfer to the budget approximately $1,150 million, representing about 45 percent of revenues. High quality investment management makes a difference!
Institutions versus Individuals
When I wrote my second book, Unconventional Success, I characterized its message as “a sensible investment framework for individuals,” in contrast to the institutional focus of Pioneering Portfolio Management. I erred in describing my target audiences. In fact, I have come to believe that the most important distinction in the investment world does not separate individuals and institutions; the most important distinction divides those investors with the ability to make high quality active management decisions from those investors without active management expertise. Few institutions and even fewer individuals exhibit the ability and commit the resources to produce risk-adjusted excess returns.
The correct strategies for investors with active management expertise fall on the opposite end of the spectrum from the appropriate approaches for investors without active management abilities. Aside from the obvious fact that skilled active managers face the opportunity to generate market-beating returns in the traditional asset classes of domestic and foreign equity, skilled active managers enjoy the more important opportunity to create lower-risk, higher-returning portfolios with the alternative asset classes of absolute return, real assets, and private equity. Only those investors with active management ability sensibly pursue market-beating strategies in traditional asset classes and portfolio allocations to nontraditional asset classes. The costly game of active management guarantees failure for the casual participant.
No middle ground exists. Low-cost passive strategies, as outlined in Unconventional Success, suit the overwhelming number of individual and institutional investors without the time, resources, and ability to make high quality active management decisions. The framework outlined in Pioneering Portfolio Management applies to only a small number of investors with the resources and temperament to pursue the grail of risk-adjusted excess returns.
The World of Endowment Management
The fascinating activity of endowment management captures the energy and imagination of many talented individuals charged with stewardship of institutional assets. Investing with a time horizon measured in centuries to support the educational and research missions of society’s colleges and universities creates a challenge guaranteed to engage the emotions and the intellect.
Aside from the appeal of the eleemosynary purposes that endowments serve, the investment business contains an independent set of attractions. Populated by unusually gifted, extremely driven individuals, the institutional funds management industry provides a nearly limitless supply of products, a few of which actually serve fiduciary aims. Mining the handful of gems from the tons of mine ore provides intellectually stimulating employment for the managers of endowment portfolios.
The knowledge base that provides useful support for investment decisions knows no bounds. A rich understanding of human psychology, a reasonable appreciation of financial theory, a deep awareness of history, and a broad exposure to current events all contribute to development of well-informed portfolio strategies. Many top-notch practitioners confess they would work without pay in the endlessly fascinating money management business.
The book begins by painting the big picture, discussing the purposes of endowment accumulation and examining the goals for institutional portfolios. Articulation of an investment philosophy provides the underpinnings for developing an asset-allocation strategy—the fundamentally important decision regarding the portion of portfolio assets devoted to each type of investment alternative.
After establishing a framework for portfolio construction, the book investigates the nitty-gritty details of implementing a successful investment program. A discussion of portfolio management issues examines situations where real world frictions might impede realization of portfolio objectives. Chapters on traditional and alternative asset classes provide a primer on investment characteristics and active management opportunities, followed by an outline of asset class management issues. The book closes with some thoughts on structuring an effective decision-making process.
The linearity of the book’s exposition of the investment process masks the complexities inherent in the portfolio management challenge. For example, asset allocation relies on a combination of top-down assessment of asset class characteristics and bottom-up evaluation of asset class opportunities. Since quantitative projections of returns, risks, and correlations describe only part of the scene, top-notch investors supplement the statistical overview with a ground-level understanding of specific investments. Because bottom-up insights into investment opportunity provide information important to assessing asset class attractiveness, effective investors consider both top-down and bottom-up factors when evaluating portfolio alternatives. By beginning with an analysis of the broad questions regarding the asset allocation framework and narrowing the discussion to issues involved with managing specific investment portfolios, the book lays out a neat progression from macro to micro, ignoring the complex simultaneity of the asset management process.
Rigorous Investment Framework
Three themes surface repeatedly in the book. The first theme centers on the importance of taking actions within the context of an analytically rigorous framework, implemented with discipline and undergirded with thorough analysis of specific opportunities. In dealing with the entire range of investment decisions from broad-based asset allocation to issue-specific security selection, investment success requires sticking with positions made uncomfortable by their variance with popular opinion. Casual commitments invite casual reversal, exposing portfolio managers to the damaging whipsaw of buying high and selling low. Only with the confidence created by a strong decision-making process can investors sell mania-induced excess and buy despair-driven value.
Establishing an analytically rigorous framework requires a ground-up examination of the investment challenges faced by the institution, evaluated in the context of the organization’s specific characteristics. All too often investors fail to address the particular investment policy needs of an institution, opting instead to adopt portfolio structures similar to those pursued by comparable institutions. In other cases, when evaluating individual investment strategies, investors make commitments based on the identity of the co-investors, not on the merits of the proposed transaction. Playing follow-the-leader exposes assets to substantial risk.
Disciplined implementation of investment decisions ensures that investors reap the rewards and incur the costs associated with the policies adopted by the institution. While many important investment activities require careful oversight, maintaining policy asset-allocation targets stands near the top of the list. Far too many investors spend enormous amounts of time and energy constructing policy portfolios, only to allow allocations, once established, to drift with the whims of the market. The process of rebalancing requires a fair degree of activity, buying and selling to bring underweight and overweight allocations to target. Without a disciplined approach to maintaining policy targets, fiduciaries fail to achieve the desired characteristics for the institution’s portfolio.
Making decisions based on thorough analysis provides the best foundation for running a strong investment program. The tough competitive nature of the investment management industry stems from the prevalence of zero-sum games where the amount by which the winners win equals the amount by which the losers lose. Carefully considered decisions provide the only intelligent basis for profitable pursuit of investment activities, ranging from broad policy decisions to narrow security selection bets.
Agency Issues
A second theme concerns the prevalence of agency issues that interfere with the successful pursuit of institutional goals. Nearly every aspect of funds management suffers from decisions made in the self-interest of the agents, at the expense of the best interest of the principals. Culprits range from trustees seeking to make an impact during their term on an investment committee to staff members acting to increase job security to portfolio managers pursuing steady fee income at the expense of investment excellence to corporate managers diverting assets for personal gain. Differences in interest between fund beneficiaries and those responsible for fund assets create potentially costly wedges between what should have been and what actually was.
The wedge between principal goals and agent actions causes problems at the highest governance level, leading to a failure to serve the interests of a perpetual life endowment fund. Individuals desire immediate gratification, leading to overemphasis of policies expected to pay off in a relatively short time frame. At the same time, fund fiduciaries hope to retain power by avoiding controversy, pursuing only conventional investment ideas. By operating in the institutional mainstream of short-horizon, uncontroversial opportunities, committee members and staff ensure unspectacular results, while missing potentially rewarding longer term contrarian plays.
Relationships with external investment managers provide a fertile breeding ground for conflicts of interest. Institutions seek high risk-adjusted returns, while outside investment advisors pursue substantial, stable flows of fee income. Conflicts arise since the most attractive investment opportunities fail to generate returns in a steady predictable fashion. To create more secure cash flows, investment firms frequently gather excessive amounts of assets, follow benchmark-hugging portfolio strategies, and dilute management efforts across a broad range of product offerings. While fiduciaries attempt to reduce conflicts with investment advisors by crafting appropriate compensation arrangements, interests of fund managers diverge from interests of capital providers even with the most carefully considered deal structures.
Most asset classes contain investment vehicles exhibiting some degree of agency risk, with corporate bonds representing an extreme case. Structural issues render corporate bonds hopelessly flawed as a portfolio alternative. Shareholder interests, with which company management generally identifies, diverge so dramatically from the goals of bondholders that lenders to companies must expect to end up on the wrong side of nearly every conflict. Yet, even in equity holdings where corporate managers share a rough coincidence of interests with outside shareholders, agency issues drive wedges between the two classes of economic actors. In every equity position, public or private, management at least occasionally pursues activities providing purely personal gains, directly damaging the interests of shareholders. To mitigate the problem, investors search for managements focused on advancing stockholder interests, while avoiding companies treated as personal piggy banks by the individuals in charge.
Every aspect of the investment management process contains real and potential conflicts between the interests of the institutional fund and the interests of the agents engaged to manage portfolio assets. Awareness of the breadth and seriousness of agency issues constitutes the first line of defense for fund managers. By evaluating each participant involved in investment activities with a skeptical attitude, fiduciaries increase the likelihood of avoiding or mitigating the most serious principal-agent conflicts.
Active Management Challenges
The third theme relates to the difficulties of managing investment portfolios to exploit asset mispricings. Both market timers and security selectors face intensely competitive environments in which the majority of participants fail. The efficiency of marketable security pricing poses formidable hurdles to investors pursuing active management strategies.
While illiquid markets provide a much greater range of mispriced assets, private investors fare little better than their marketable security counterparts as the extraordinary fee burden typical of private equity funds almost guarantees delivery of disappointing risk-adjusted results. Active management strategies, whether in public markets or private, generally fail to meet investor expectations.
In spite of the daunting obstacles to active management success, the overwhelming majority of market participants choose to play the loser’s game. Like the residents of Lake Wobegon who all believe their children to be above average, nearly all investors believe their active strategies will produce superior results. The harsh reality of the negative-sum game dictates that, in aggregate, active managers lose to the market by the amount it costs to play in the form of management fees, trading commissions, and dealer spread. Wall Street’s share of the pie defines the amount of performance drag experienced by the would-be market beaters.
The staff resources required to create portfolios with a reasonable chance of producing superior asset class returns place yet another obstacle in the path of institutions considering active management strategies. Promising investments come to light only after culling dozens of mediocre alternatives. Hiring and compensating the personnel needed to identify out-of-the-mainstream opportunities imposes a burden too great for many institutions to accept. The alternative of trying to pursue active strategies on-the-cheap exposes assets to material danger. Casual attempts to beat the market provide fodder for organizations willing to devote the resources necessary to win.
Even with adequate numbers of high quaility personnel, active management strategies demand uninstitutional behavior from institutions, creating a paradox few successfully unravel. Establishing and maintaining an unconventional investment profile requires acceptance of uncomfortably idiosyncratic portfolios, which frequently appear downright imprudent in the eyes of conventional wisdom. Unless institutions maintain contrarian positions through difficult times, the resulting damage of buying high and selling low imposes severe financial and reputational costs on the institution.
*  *  *
Even though the investment lessons in this book focus on the challenges and rewards of investing educational endowment funds, the ideas described in these pages address issues of value to all participants in financial markets. Perhaps most important, readers might develop an understanding of the extraordinary requirements for successful pursuit of active management strategies. Rigorous self-assessment leads to segregation of those with active management ability from those without, increasing chances for investment success by understanding which activities to avoid and which activities to pursue.
Beyond the pragmatic possibility of improving investment outcomes, students of finance might enjoy exploring the thought process underlying the management of a large institutional fund. Because fund managers operate in an environment that requires insights into tools ranging from the technical rigors of modern finance to the qualitative judgments of behavioral science, the funds management problem spans an improbably wide range of disciplines, providing material of interest to a broad group of market observers.

Endowment Purposes
Institutions accumulate endowments for a number of purposes. A significant level of endowment support for university operations enhances institutional autonomy and provides an independent source of revenues, thereby reducing dependence on government grants, student charges, and alumni donations. Financial stability increases with the level of sustainable endowment distributions, facilitating long-term planning and increasing institutional strength. Finally, since colleges and universities tend to post strikingly similar tuition levels, better-endowed institutions enjoy an incremental income stream, providing the means to create a superior teaching and research environment.
Institutions without permanent financial resources support day-today operations with funds from sources that frequently demand a voice in organizational governance. Government grants expose colleges and universities to a host of regulations concerning matters far afield from the direct purpose of the activity receiving financial support. Gifts from alumni and friends often contain explicit or implicit requirements, some of which may not be completely congruent with institutional aspirations. In an organization’s early years, when any source of income might represent the difference between survival and failure, institutions prove particularly vulnerable to the strings attached to external income flows.
Universities frequently make long-term commitments as part of the regular course of operations. For example, awarding tenure to a faculty member represents a financial obligation that might span decades. Funding such an enduring obligation with temporary sources of funds exposes the institution (and the individual) to the risk of disruption in revenue flows. The permanent nature of endowment funds matches nicely the long-term character of tenure commitments.
Some institutional constituencies view endowments with a decidedly short-term horizon. Students generally prefer greater levels of support today, expecting that higher expenditures translate into better, less expensive education. Faculty recognize that current resources provide the wherewithal to pursue a more comprehensive set of scholarly activities, while administrators see enhanced financial flows as the means to relax the binding constraint of budgetary discipline. Some donors suggest increasing endowment payout as a means to reduce the pressures associated with raising current use funds. Trustees ultimately face the difficult-to-resolve tension between desire to support current programs and obligation to preserve assets for future generations.
Colleges and universities stand among the most long-lived institutions in society. By charting an independent course in fulfilling a mission of teaching and scholarship, the academy adds immeasurably to the quality of life. Endowment funds contribute to the educational enterprise by providing institutions with greater independence, increased financial stability, and the means to create a margin of excellence.
MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE
Endowment accumulation facilitates institutional autonomy, since reliance on impermanent income sources to support operations exposes institutions to the conditions attached by providers of funds. For example, when the government awards grants to support specific research projects, university-wide activities frequently face requirements and regulations even though the affected operations may be far removed from the grant beneficiary. Similarly, colleges relying on donor gifts for current use often find that benefactors demand a significant voice in the institution’s activities. Even educational institutions that rely heavily on tuition income may be constrained by that dependency, perhaps by responding to current trends and fashions to attract sufficient numbers of students to maintain operations. Greater institutional needs for current income correspond to greater degrees of external influence.
Educational institutions certainly must respond to government policy and take into account donor wishes and student desires. However, at times such influences detract from the ability of trustees to pursue well-considered institutional goals. Endowment accumulation allows educational institutions to be accountable to their constituencies without being held hostage by them.
Donors to endowment often attach meaningful restrictions to gifts, stipulating that funds provide permanent support for designated purposes. Occasionally, such requirements come into conflict with institutional goals, as might be the case when an endowment supports a field of study long since abandoned by scholars. More frequently, endowment gifts provide restricted support to fund activities central to organizational aspirations, such as teaching and financial aid. Even though donors exercise considerable influence in negotiating the initial terms of an endowment gift, after establishing the fund, donor influence wanes.
Attracting short-term sources of income requires institutions to respond to a combination of explicit and implicit pressures. Institutions that benefit from a stable stream of endowment income stand a greater chance of maintaining independence from external pressures. Support of the operating budget by endowment fosters academic freedom and allows independent governance.
Yale and Connecticut
The survival of the fledgling Yale in the early eighteenth century depended on generous legislative and financial support from the Colony of Connecticut. In October 1701 the General Assembly of the Colony of Connecticut approved a proposal put forth by five Connecticut ministers to charter a college: “Wherein Youth may be instructed in the Arts and Sciences who through the blessing of Almighty God may be fitted for Publick employment both in Church and Civil State.” Support for Yale included grants of land, special grants for construction or repair of college buildings, authorization for briefs or lotteries, duties on rum, and the exemption of ministers, ministers’ tutors, and students from taxes. Brooks Mather Kelley, in his Yale—A History, estimates that “throughout the eighteenth century, Connecticut’s contribution amounted to more than one half the total gifts to the college.”1
The colony’s support came with a price. For instance, in 1755, the general assembly voted to refuse the annual grant to Yale, ostensibly because of wartime expenditures, but in fact to retaliate for a controversial position taken by Yale President Clapp concerning the religious character of the college. In 1792, in exchange for renewed financial support, the governor, lieutenant governor, and six legislators became fellows of the Yale Corporation. The presence of the state-appointed representatives on the Yale governing board caused discord and conflict, with disagreements ranging from the proper religious faith of the faculty to the general assembly’s rights in reforming abuses in the running of the college.
State-appointed representatives served on the Yale Corporation until the termination of state support for Yale in 1871, which resulted in the withdrawal of the state senators from the Yale Corporation.2 With the replacement of the six legislators by fellows elected by Yale’s alumni body, control became more firmly centered in the college. Yale’s experience mirrored national trends. With the end of the Civil War and the rise of Darwinism and laissez-faire philosophies, the previous view of the major role of the state in the support of private education had shifted. As historian Frederick Rudolph noted, “a partnership in public service, which had once been essential to the colleges and inherent in the responsibilities of government . . . [became] insidious or . . . forgotten altogether.” Fortunately for Yale, this withdrawal of public support was replaced by organized alumni support.3
The appointment of elected officials to the university’s governing board in exchange for financial support illustrates in the starkest fashion the loss of control associated with reliance on external sources of funds. While the nearly eighty years of direct state influence on Yale’s governance represents an extreme case, more subtle issues of outside influence continue to test the wisdom of today’s trustees. Balancing the legitimate interest of providers of funds in having a voice with the fundamental need of private institutions to maintain ultimate control poses a difficult challenge to fiduciaries responsible for managing educational organizations.
Federal Support for Academic Research
The benefits and dangers of reliance on government support have shaped private educational institutions throughout their history. Many scholars credit the influx in the 1960s of federal dollars for research in higher education with the rise to preeminence of the American research university. However, the costs of this support to the administrative flexibility of the universities became painfully evident in the 1970s.
In their extensive study of the American research university, Hugh Graham and Nancy Diamond note that federal support for research resulted in “increased congressional involvement, an emphasis on targeted research, and a general trend toward government regulation of the private sector.”4 During the late 1960s and early 1970s federal regulation of universities slowly but steadily embraced issues such as hiring, promotion, and firing of university personnel (including faculty); research; admissions; toxic waste disposal; human and animal subjects of research; access for the handicapped; wage and salary administration; pensions and benefits; plant construction and management; record keeping; athletics; fund-raising; and in some cases, curricula.5
With this new web of federal regulation came increased costs and bureaucracy for the universities. In a widely quoted claim, Harvard President Derek Bok noted that compliance with federal regulations at Harvard consumed over sixty thousand hours of faculty time and cost almost $8.3 million in the mid 1970s. A 1980 study found that meeting regulatory costs absorbed as much as 7 to 8 percent of total institutional budgets.6
The reduction in administrative autonomy poses a significant threat to institutional governance. In his Report of the President for 1974–1975, Yale President Kingman Brewster stated: “. . . the experience of recent years gives fair warning that reliance upon government support for any university activity may subject the entire university to conditions and requirements which can undermine the capacity of faculty and trustees to chart the institution’s destiny.”
When well-endowed institutions accept external financial support, compliance with the accompanying requirements no doubt influences institutional policies. That said, such compliance generally poses no fundamental threat to the integrity of the institution. The greater the independent flow of financial resources from endowment assets, the greater the ability of an institution either to avoid external funds with onerous requirements or to negotiate changes mitigating undesirable regulations. In cases where organizations lack substantial independent means, external funds providers wield the potential to reshape the institution, threatening to alter the fundamental character of the college or university.
University of Bridgeport
In the early 1990s, severe financial distress caused the University of Bridgeport to lose its independence after a desperate fight to survive. From a peak of more than 9,000 students in the 1970s to fewer than 4,000 in 1991, declining enrollment created budgetary trauma, forcing the school to consider radical measures. In spite of the institution’s dire straits, in October 1991, the University of Bridgeport rejected an offer of $50 million from the Professors World Peace Academy, an arm of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church. Preferring to pursue independent policies, the institution’s trustees elected to take the drastic step of eliminating nearly one-third of its ninety degree programs, while petitioning a judge to dip into restricted endowment funds to meet payroll costs.
After running out of options in April 1992, the trustees of the university reversed course, ceding control to the Professors World Peace Academy in exchange for an infusion of more than $50 million over five years. As board members associated with the Unification Church took control, the sixty-five-year-old institution received a new mission:—to serve as “the foundation of a worldwide network of universities striving for international harmony and understanding.”7
Three years later, the Reverend Sun Myung Moon received an honorary degree from the University of Bridgeport, which recognized him as a “religious leader and a man of true spiritual power.”8 During Reverend Moon’s appearance on campus, he took credit for the fall of communism and promised to resolve conflicts in the Middle East and Korea. Claiming that “the entire world did everything it could to put an end to me,” the Reverend Moon said that “today I am firmly standing on top of the world.”9 According to the New York Times, the speech provided further evidence to critics that the “once sturdy university” sold its independence for an infusion of capital from “a religious cult with a messianic and proselytizing mission.”
The University of Bridgeport’s demise resulted from a number of factors, yet a more substantial endowment might have allowed the institution to maintain its independence. The lack of a stable financial foundation exposed the university to wrenching change, causing varying degrees of distress among important institutional constituencies.
External support for colleges and universities frequently comes with collateral requirements designed to influence institutional behavior. In extreme cases, outside agents seek to change the fundamental character of an organization. The greater the extent to which endowment funds provide support for operations, the greater the ability of an institution to pursue its own course.
PROVIDE STABILITY
Endowments contribute to operational stability by providing reliable flows of resources to operating budgets. Nonpermanent funding sources fluctuate, and may diminish or disappear, as government policies change, donor generosity diminishes, or student interest wanes. By reducing variability in university revenues, endowments enhance operational viability and promote long-term planning.
Yale and Josiah Willard Gibbs
Yale’s history is riddled with instances of budgetary problems due to fluctuating current income. On numerous occasions the university operated at a deficit, forcing faculty to forego full salaries. In an extreme example, the “greatest scholar Yale has ever produced or harbored,” Josiah Willard Gibbs, renowned for his seminal research in physics and engineering, received an appointment as professor of mathematical physics without salary in 1871, indicating “not any lack of esteem for Gibbs, but rather the poverty of Yale.” In 1880, officials at Johns Hopkins University attempted to woo Gibbs from Yale with an offer of a $3,000 salary.
The well-known geologist and mineralogist, Yale Professor James Dwight Dana, convinced Yale President Noah Porter to provide Gibbs with a salary of $2,000 and a promise to increase the salary as soon as funds were available. In a letter to Gibbs, Dana implored the brilliant professor to stay loyal to Yale: “. . . I do not wonder that Johns Hopkins wants your name and services, or that you feel inclined to consider favorable their proposition, for nothing has been done toward endowing your professorship, and there are not here the means or signs of progress which tend to incite courage in professors and multiply earnest students. But I hope nevertheless that you will stand by us, and that something will speedily be done by way of endowment to show you that your services are really valued . . . Johns Hopkins can get on vastly better without you than we can. We can not.”10
Gibbs eventually received Yale’s prestigious Berkeley fellowship for postgraduate scholarship, endowed in 1731 by George Berkeley with the gift of a ninety-six-acre farm in Newport, Rhode Island. Funded by income from the farm, the fellowship supported some of Yale’s most illustrious graduates including Eleazer Wheelock, the first president of Dartmouth College, and Eugene Schuyler, the first American to hold the Ph.D.
Today, endowed chairs serve largely to confer honor on distinguished faculty members; in Gibbs’s era support from the endowment conferred both prestige and financial security. That said, even today, the credibility of an institution’s promise to provide ongoing financial support creates an important competitive edge in recruiting and retaining faculty.
Stanford University
Endowment distributions occasionally provide more than year-to-year stability in funding operations. In times of severe economic stress, well-endowed institutions employ extraordinary distributions to weather the storm, while those with meager permanent resources face the consequences of substantial financial trauma more directly.
In 1991, Stanford lost significant amounts of financial support from the federal government in a controversy over cost recoveries that the university claimed in connection with federally sponsored research activity. Stanford allegedly overbilled the government, seeking reimbursement for headline-grabbing charges associated with the seventy-two-foot yacht Victoria, a nineteenth century Italian fruitwood commode, and a Lake Tahoe retreat for university trustees.11 Primarily as a result of the “continued impact of the disputes with the federal government,” the university posted a 1992 operating deficit in excess of $32.5 million, representing nearly 3 percent of revenues.
Facing projected deficits aggregating $125 million over three years, Stanford sought to “finance the expected losses while expense reduction programs were implemented.” A critical component of the “financing” plan involved increasing the endowment payout rate from 4.75 percent to 6.75 percent for 1993 and 1994, releasing a projected incremental $58 million to support operations during Stanford’s period of adjustment.
The combination of increased endowment spending, reduced expenditures, and incremental borrowing placed the university on firm financial footing. In 1995, basking in the glow of a substantial operating surplus, Stanford lowered the payout rate to 5.25 percent, nearly returning to the “customary rate of 4.75 percent.”12 The extraordinary increase in the endowment spending rate provided a cushion for Stanford’s operations, allowing the university to deal with a sudden, significant loss of funds with minimal disruption.
Yet the use of permanent funds to finance temporary operating shortfalls imposed substantial costs on Stanford. In the five years following the university’s extraordinary payout rate increase, strong investment returns led to more than a doubling in asset values. Certainly, with twenty-twenty hindsight, Stanford would have benefited by using much lower-cost external borrowing to fund the budget deficits, leaving the payout rate at its “customary” level of 4.75 percent. Considering the longer-term impact of withdrawal of permanent funds reinforces concerns regarding the ultimate cost of unusually high rates of spending from endowment.
Reliable distributions from endowment contribute to the stability of educational institutions. Under normal operating circumstances, greater levels of endowment serve to improve the quality of an organization’s revenue stream, allowing heavier reliance on internally generated income. When faced with extraordinary financial stress, endowment assets provide a cushion, either by paying out unusually large distributions or by serving as support for external borrowing, giving the institution the capacity to address disruptive fiscal issues. A substantial endowment creates a superior everyday budgetary environment and enhances the ability to deal with unusual financial trauma.
CREATE A MARGIN OF EXCELLENCE
Endowments produce resources that allow an institution to establish a superior educational environment. On the margin, endowment income attracts better scholars, provides superior facilities, and funds pioneering research. While financial resources fail to translate directly into educational excellence, incremental funds provide the means for the faculty, administration, and trustees to develop an unusually robust educational institution.
Endowments and Institutional Quality
Endowment size correlates strongly with institutional quality. A survey of major private research universities shows that larger, better-endowed organizations score more highly in the U.S. News and World Report rankings of educational institutions.13 While the U.S. News and World Report rankings garner a fair share of controversy, much of the debate centers around the rank order of institutions. Placing the major research universities into quartiles reduces the focus on numerical order and produces a set of categories that group like with like. The quartile groupings show a strong correlation between excellence and endowment size.
Public universities fall outside of the study because budgetary issues for state-supported institutions differ significantly from those of private universities. For example, government appropriations play a much greater role for public institutions than for private. If public authorities wish to support institutions at a particular level, changes in levels of endowment income might be offset by altering levels of state support for the universities. Strong endowment distributions may correspond to weak state subventions, while weak endowment support may elicit higher state contributions. Public institutions face investment and spending problems that differ fundamentally from those of private universities.
Major private research universities have strikingly similar tuition streams. In 2004, among the top twenty research universities in the survey, undergraduate tuition ranged from $19,670 to $32,265, a reasonably tight band. Eliminating the high and low outliers produces a range of $24,117 to $29,910. Among the top five institutions, tuition charges fell in an even narrower band from $28,400 to $29,910. Price discrimination, at least with respect to posted tuition levels, appears to be quite weak among leading universities.
Large private universities operate substantial enterprises, with 2004 revenues ranging from $74 million to nearly $2.8 billion, averaging $722 million. To put the revenue numbers in a corporate context, eleven of sixty-one institutions run budgets sufficiently large to rank among the Fortune 1000 companies.14
Student income provides the largest single source of income to research universities, accounting for more than 48 percent of revenues. Grants and contracts supply nearly 25 percent of cash flow, investment income about 13 percent, and contributions 8 percent. The catch-all remainder amounts to less than 6 percent of revenues.
Ranking institutions by quality poses a host of challenges, because such rankings involve reducing the characteristics of a complex, multifaceted institution to a single number. Nonetheless, a cottage industry, led by U.S. News and World Report, produces widely followed annual ratings of colleges and universities.
In part, because of the impossibility of making precise distinctions where none exist, the ratings engender controversy. In the U.S. News and World Report evaluation, the magazine assesses academic reputation, student retention, faculty resources, admissions selectivity, financial wherewithal, graduation rates, and alumni giving rates.15 Combining measures such as SAT scores, class size, and graduation rates, the publication fashions a ranking scheme of colleges and universities. While the precise rank order causes much debate, the general groupings of institutions make intuitive sense.
Dividing the large private universities into quartiles according to their academic ranking allows examination of the relationship between investment income and institutional quality. Table 2.1 lists (alphabetically) the institutions falling into each particular group.
Quality ranking and endowment size exhibit a strong correlation, with top quartile institutions benefiting from endowments averaging just in excess of $6.0 billion, in contrast to the bottom quartile average of $324 million. Moving from one quartile to the next, a clear step pattern emerges, indicating a direct relationship between endowment assets and institutional achievement.
The level of endowment per student tells the same story. Top quartile universities enjoy nearly $530,000 in endowment assets for each full-time equivalent (FTE) student. After dramatic declines to approximately $190,000 for the second quartile and just over $61,000 for the third quartile, bottom quartile institutions average only $43,000 per student. Endowment size correlates clearly and strongly with institutional quality.
The degree to which investment income supports research institution budgets varies dramatically. As seen in Table 2.2, top quartile university investment assets produce 19.1 percent of revenues. In contrast, bottom quartile institutions receive roughly one-third the relative support, with investments contributing 6.8 percent of income.
Since higher quality institutions tend to be larger, greater relative levels of investment income translate into dramatically greater numbers of dollars. Top quartile institutions operate with an average draw of $274 million, while lower quartile universities receive only $17 million.
Student charges provide the complement to investment income. As institutional quality increases, budgetary dependence on student charges decreases. Top quartile institutions rely on student income for 24.5 percent of revenues, while bottom quartile universities obtain 64.5 percent of revenues from such charges, a spread of 40 percent. Lower quality institutions rely heavily on tuition. Yet viewed on a per capita basis, student charges show a remarkably consistent pattern across the quartiles, with figures ranging from $26,800 for the top quartile to $19,400 for the bottom quartile. Better-endowed universities use their financial strength to create a richer educational environment.
Grants and contracts display a strong relationship with institutional quality, providing nearly 38 percent of revenues for top quartile institutions and declining monotonically to just over 16 percent of revenues for bottom quartile universities. As in the case of investment income, the combination of the top institutions’ larger budgets and larger shares translates into substantially more grant and contract income for research activity at large, high quality universities.

Annual giving numbers fall into a reasonably narrow range from 6.9 percent to 9.0 percent of revenues and exhibit no particular pattern. Even though top quartile universities receive a smaller percentage of revenues from current gifts, the dollars given to top quartile institutions exceed the dollars for all other institutions combined.
While endowment size clearly correlates with institutional quality, the direction of causality remains unclear. Do higher quality institutions attract higher levels of endowment support, creating a self-reinforcing virtuous cycle? Or do larger endowments provide the resources required to build superior institutions, facilitating the creation of a margin of excellence? Regardless of the direction of causation, greater financial resources correlate with superior educational environments.
CONCLUSION 
Endowments serve a number of important purposes for educational institutions—allowing greater independence, providing enhanced stability, and facilitating educational excellence. Institutions of higher education best serve society as independent forums for free and open inquiry, promoting unfettered pursuit of ideas regardless of convention or controversy. The conditions attached to sources of outside financial support contain the potential to create institutional sensitivities, limiting healthy debate and impairing open inquiry.For established institutions, endowments enhance operating independence and budgetary stability. Sizable reserves of permanent funds allow trustees to resistgovernment interference and unreasonable donor requirements. Large endowments enable administrators to smooth the impact of financial shocks, buffering operations against disruptive external forces.For less established institutions, endowments sometimes determine the difference between survival and failure. In the decade ending June 2007, more than one hundred degree granting institutions closed, representing approximately 3 percent of the total number of such institutions in the United States.16 Well-endowed institutions enjoy a level of fiscal support that cushions financial and operating blows. Even modest endowments make a significant difference.Endowments provide the means to produce a margin of excellence. Better-endowed institutions enjoy an incremental source of funds available for deployment to create a superior educational environment. By contributing to the excellence of superior colleges and universities, endowments play an important role in the world of higher education.Understanding the purposes that drive endowment accumulation represents an important first step in structuring an investment portfolio. By defining the reasons endowments exist, fiduciaries lay the groundwork for articulation of specific investment goals, shaping in a fundamental manner the investment policy and process.

Investment and Spending Goals
Endowment managers pursue the conflicting goals of preserving purchasing power of assets and providing substantial flows of resources to the operating budget. If fiduciaries produce spending and investment policies that deal successfully with the tension between the goals, the institution receives a sustainable contribution from endowment assets to support academic programs. Asset preservation and stable budgetary support, if achieved, satisfy the purposes of endowment accumulation—maintaining independence, providing stability, and creating a margin of excellence.Benjamin Franklin observed that death and taxes represent life’s only certainties. Managers of endowment assets suspend those certainties, as educational institutions aspire to exist in perpetuity and endowment assets enjoy exemption from taxes. The perpetual nature of colleges and universities makes endowment management one of the investment world’s most fascinating endeavors. Balancing the tension between preserving long-run asset purchasing power and providing substantial current operating support provides a rich set of challenges, posing problems unique to endowed educational institutions.Purchasing power preservation represents a long-term goal, spanning generations. Successfully managed endowments retain forever the ability to provide a particular level of institutional support, justifying the classification of endowment funds as permanent assets. Pursuit of long-term asset preservation requires seeking high returns, accepting the accompanying fundamental risk and associated market volatility.Stable operating support constitutes an intermediate-term goal, reflecting the demands of a shorter-term budgetary planning cycle. Since academic programs contract only with great difficulty, institutions rely on reasonably predictable flows of funds from endowment to support operations. Supplying stable distributions for current operations requires dampening portfolio volatility, suggesting lower levels of fundamental risk with the accompanying lower levels of expected returns.The high risk, high return investment policy best suited to serve asset preservation conflicts with the low risk, low return investment approach more likely to produce stable distributions to the operating budget. Spending policies deal with the conflict, in part by dampening the transmission of portfolio volatility to budgetary distributions. Further, by specifying institutional preferences regarding the trade-off between purchasing power preservation and stability of flows to fund operations, spending policies determine the degree to which endowments meet the needs of current and future generations.INVESTMENT GOALSThe late Yale economist James Tobin captured the essence of the investment problem facing fiduciaries:The trustees of an endowed institution are the guardians of the future against the claims of the present. Their task is to preserve equity among generations. The trustees of an endowed university like my own assume the institution to be immortal. They want to know, therefore, the rate of consumption from endowment which can be sustained indefinitely. . . . In formal terms, the trustees are supposed to have a zero subjective rate of time preference.Consuming endowment income so defined means in principle that the existing endowment can continue to support the same set of activities that it is now supporting. This rule says that the current consumption should not benefit from the prospects of future gifts to endowment. Sustained consumption rises to encompass and enlarge the scope of activities when, but not before, capital gifts enlarge the endowment.1Tobin’s concept of intergenerational equity comports with the goals of purchasing power preservation and stable operating budget support. By preserving endowment assets adjusted for inflation, the institution retains the ability to “support the same set of activities that it is now supporting.” In supplying a stable flow of resources for operations, the endowment provides continuity of support, avoiding disruptive interruptions indistributions to academic programs.Gifts and EndowmentWhen making an endowment gift, donors intend to provide permanent support for the designated activity. If financial managers maintain only the nominal value of gifts, inflation ultimately reduces to insignificance the impact of the fund. Yale’s oldest surviving endowment fund dedicated to the support of teaching, the Timothy Dwight Professorship Fund established in 1822, entered the university’s books at an historical cost basis slightly in excess of $27,000. Because price levels rose nearly twenty-seven fold in the intervening 185 years, a 2007 distribution from an endowment of $27,000 pales in comparison to an 1822 distribution from the same size fund. While during the Dwight Professorship’s existence, the fund grew more than eighteen times to nearly $500,000, the current value falls short of the inflation-adjusted target by nearly one-third. Even though the university continues to benefit from the Timothy Dwight Professorship in the early twenty-first century, after accounting for inflation the fund fails to provide the same level of support available in the early nineteenth century. While fiduciary principles generally specify only that the institution preserve the nominal value of a gift,I to provide true permanent support institutions must maintain the inflation-adjusted value of a gift.Explicitly stating that new gifts allow an institution to “enlarge the scope of activities,” Tobin recognizes a principle important to endowment benefactors. Some institutions factor gifts into spending considerations, targeting a consumption level equal to the portfolio’s expected real return plus new gifts. Harvard University, in fashioning its 1974 spending policy, assumed that “university expense growth would exceed [the long-term inflation] rate by two points.”2 Yet the institution’stargeted reinvestment rate offset only the general level of inflation, not the higher university expense growth. Obviously, supporting the “same set of activities” required keeping pace with university expense growth, not general inflation, rendering the reinvestment rate inadequate to its purpose. To maintain endowment purchasing power, Harvard articulated a goal of accumulating sufficient new capital gifts to offset the difference between the general inflation rate and university expense growth. In so doing, the university explicitly employed new gifts to replenish inflationary losses.3Using new gifts to offset part of the impact of inflation on asset values fails to “enlarge the scope of activities” supported by endowment. If a fund devoted to supporting a chair in the economics department loses purchasing power, establishing a new chair in the law school does nothing to replenish the economics department’s loss. From a bottom-up basis, donors have the right to expect that each individual endowment fund will retain purchasing power through time.Trade-off Between Today and TomorrowFund managers charged only with preserving portfolio purchasing power face a straightforward task. Simply accumulating a portfolio of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) allows investors to generate inflation-sensitive returns guaranteed by the government. Unfortunately, the excess of university inflation over general price inflation may well consume any incremental returns from TIPS, providing almost no real return to the institution. Such single-minded focus on asset preservation fails to meet institutional needs, as merely accumulating a portfolio of assets with stable purchasing power provides little, if any, benefit to the academic enterprise.Endowment assets benefit educational institutions primarily by generating substantial reliable distributions to support operations. Fund managers with a narrow focus on providing generous predictable spending flows face little problem, particularly when operating with an intermediate time horizon. By holding assets that promise low levels of volatility, managers create a stable portfolio that allows budget planners to forecast payouts with reasonable certainty. Unfortunately, low risk investment portfolios deliver returns insufficient both to support substantial distributions and to preserve purchasing power. Exclusive pursuit of stable support for current operations favors today’s generation of scholars over tomorrow’s beneficiaries.A clear direct trade-off exists between preserving assets and supporting operations. To the extent that managers focus on maintaining purchasing power of endowment assets, substantial volatility influences the flow of resources delivered to the operating budget. To the extent that managers emphasize providing a sizable and stable flow of resources to the operating budget, substantial volatility influences the purchasing power of endowment assets.Consider two extreme policies to determine the annual spending from an endowment. One extreme, placing maintenance of asset purchasing power at center stage, requires spending each year only the real returns generated by the portfolio. Assume a particular yearproduces investment returns of 10 percent and inflation of 4 percent. Distributing 6 percent of assets to the operating units provides substantial support to operations, while reinvesting 4 percent in the endowment offsets inflation and maintains purchasing power. The following year, in an environment with 2 percent investment returns and 7 percent inflation, the institution faces a serious problem. Compensation for inflation requires a 7 percent reinvestment in the endowment, but the fund generated a return of only 2 percent. The endowment manager cannot ask the operating units for a 5 percent rebate to maintain portfolio purchasing power. At best, the institution can declare no distribution, hoping to generate positive real returns in following years to replenish lost purchasing power and, perhaps, to provide operational support. From an operating budget perspective, a policy that places year-by-year maintenance of purchasing power above all else proves unacceptable.The other policy extreme, pursuing a goal of providing a completely stable flow of resources to the operating budget, requires spending amounts that increase each year by the amount of inflation. In the short term, the policy provides perfectly stable inflation-adjusted distributions from the endowment to the operating budget. While under normal market conditions such a policy might not harm the endowment, serious damage results when faced with a hostile financial environment. In a period of high inflation accompanied by bear markets for investment assets, spending at a level independent of the value of assets creates the potential to permanently damage the endowment fund.Spending policies specify the trade-off between protecting endowment assets for tomorrow’s scholars and providing endowment support for today’s beneficiaries. Cleverly crafted rules for determining annual endowment distributions reduce the tension between the objectives of spending stability and asset preservation, increasing the likelihood of meeting the needs of both current and future generations.SPENDING POLICYSpending policies resolve the tension between the competing goals of preservation of endowment and stability in spending. Sensible policies cause current-year spending to relate both to prior-year endowment distributions and to contemporaneous endowment values, with the former factor providing a core upon which planners can rely and the latter factor introducing sensitivity to market influences.Yale’s Spending PolicyBased on a structure created by economists James Tobin, William Brainard, Richard Cooper, and William Nordhaus, Yale’s policy relates current year spending both to the previous level of spending from endowment and to the previous endowment market value. Under Yale’s rule, spending for a given year equals 80 percent of spending in the previous year plus 20 percent of the long-term spending rate applied to the endowment’s market level at the previous fiscal year end. The resulting figure is brought forward to the current year by using an inflation adjustment. Since previous levels of spending depend on past endowment market values, present spending can beexpressed in terms of endowment levels going back through time. The resulting lagged adjustment process averages past endowment levels with exponentially decreasing weights.The accompanying chart, Figure 3.1, shows weights applied to endowment values of previous years (ignoring the inflation adjustment). Multiplying the weights by the endowment values for the respective years and summing the results determines spending for the current year. Note that years farther in the past have less influence on the calculation than more recent years. In contrast, a simple four-year average would apply equal 25 percent weights to each of the four most recent years.By reducing the impact on the operating budget of inevitable fluctuations in endowment value caused by investing in risky assets, spending rules that employ an averaging process insulate the academic enterprise from unacceptably high year-to-year swings in support. Because sensible spending policies dampen the consequences of portfolio volatility, portfolio managers gain the freedom to accept greater investment risk with the expectation of achieving higher return without exposing the institution to unreasonably large probabilities of significant budgetary shortfalls.Figure 3.1 Yale’s Spending Policy Insulates the Budget from Market FluctuationsInfluence of Past Endowment Levels in Determining Current SpendingSource: Yale University Investments Office.By doing a particularly effective job of smoothing contributions to the operating budget, Yale’s elegant spending rule contributes an important measure of flexibility to the university’s investment policy. Instead of employing a simple averaging process that unceremoniously drops the oldest number in favor of the new, as time passes Yale’s exponentially declining weights gradually squeeze out the influence of a particular year’s endowment value. The superior smoothing characteristics reduce the transmission of investment volatility to the operating budget, allowing pursuit of portfolio strategies promising higher expected returns.The 80 percent weight on previous year’s spending and the 20 percent weight on current target spending reflect institutional choices regarding the trade-off between spending stability and purchasing power preservation. Different institutions may well exhibit different preferences. Moreover, institutional preferences may change over time. In fact, as Yale’s endowment support moved from one-tenth of revenues in the mid 1980s to one-third of revenues in the mid 2000s, the university opted for greater stability in operating budget support. By changing the weight on previous year’s spending from 70 percent to 80 percent, Yale reduced the likelihood of a disruptive spending drop (at the expenseof greater risk to purchasing power preservation).Other Spending PoliciesThroughout most of the twentieth century, institutions typically followed a practice of distributing for current expenditure only income generated in the form of interest, dividends, and rents. Yale, which in 1965 began spending “a prudent portion of the appreciation in market value,” noted two reasons for adopting the new policy:First, it is only by coincidence that Yield will be a correct balance between the present and the future. . . . Second, when Yield is the sole measure of what can be spent for present needs, a situation of annually increasing needs, such as has obtained for many years and seems likely to continue for many more, forces investment policy to seek to improve current Yield. But this, in turn, under market conditions prevailing most of the time since World War II, could only be done at the loss of some potential Gain.4Concerns about “invading principal” no doubt underlie the policies of institutions that base spending on the income generated by a portfolio. As Yale recognized, the distinction between current income and capital appreciation proves too easily manipulated to provide a sound foundation for spending policy.Consider the spending implications of discount, par, and premium bonds with comparable levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates, as set forth in Table 3.1. Although these bonds exhibit remarkably similar investment attributes, spending implications differ dramatically for an institution pursuing a policy of consuming all current income. The zero coupon bond provides no current cash flow, the par bond generates a 6 percent yield, and the premium bond pays out a well-above-market rate of 12 percent. Naturally, holding low coupon bonds leads to lower current spending and higher future portfolio value, while the opposite consequences stem from owning high coupon bonds. Fortunately, income-based spending rules determine spending for far fewer institutions today than in the late 1980s, when nearly one in five of educational institutions followed a policy of spending portfolio yield.5Table 3.1 Otherwise Similar Bonds Generate Dramatically Different Cash FlowsCoupon, Duration, Price, and Yield for Three Different Types of Bonds CouponDurationaPriceYieldZero coupon0%10 years55.46%Par610 years100.06Premium1210 years166.56aThe maturity of the zero coupon bond is 10 years, the par bond 15 years, and the premium bond 18.5 years.Today, seven in ten educational institutions determine spending by applying a prespecified percentage to a moving average of endowment values. Including past endowment values provides stability, because those past values determined in part the previous year’s spending. Incorporating the current endowment value ensures that spending responds to market conditions, avoiding potential for damage caused by spending at levelsunrelated to endowment value.Some institutions spend a prespecified percentage of beginning endowment market value, thereby transmitting portfolio volatility directly to the operating budget. On the opposite end of the spectrum, some colleges and universities spend a prespecified percentage of the previous year’s spending, potentially threatening endowment purchasing power preservation with market-insensitive spending levels.A number of institutions decide each year on an appropriate rate, or have no established rule. This practice, although superficially appealing, fails to instill the financial discipline provided by a rigorous spending rule. In the absence of a well-defined spending policy, budgetary balance becomes meaningless. Spend enough to bridge the gap between revenues and expenses to produce a balanced budget. Spend less to create a deficit. Spend more to fashion a surplus. Balance, distress, and prosperity rest in the hands of the spending committee. Fiscal discipline disappears.Target Spending RateThe target rate of spending plays a critical role in determining the degree of intergenerational equity. Spending at levels inconsistent with investment returns either diminishes or enhances future endowment levels. Too much current spending causes future endowment levels to fall, benefiting today’s scholars; too little current spending causes future endowment levels to rise, benefiting tomorrow’s scholars. Selecting a distribution rate appropriate to the endowment portfolio balances the demands of today with the responsibilities of tomorrow.Target spending rates among endowed institutions range from a surprisingly low 0.1 percent to an unsustainably high 15.5 percent. More than 70 percent of institutions employ target rates between 4.0 percent and 6.0 percent, with about one in six using a 5.0 percent rate.6 The appropriate rate of spending depends on the risk and return characteristics of the investment portfolio, the structure of the spending policy, and the preferences expressed by trustees regarding the tradeoff between stable budgetary support and asset preservation.Analysis of investment and spending policies leads to the conclusion that distribution rates for educational institutions generally exceed the return-producing capacity of endowment assets. According to a series of simulations conducted by the Yale Investments Office, the average endowment faces a nearly 20 percent intermediate-term probability of a disruptive decline in operating budget support. More troubling may be the almost 40 percent long-run likelihood of losing one-half of endowment purchasing power.II High probabilities of intermediate-term spending volatility and long-term purchasing power decline indicate an inconsistency between expected portfolio returns and projected spending rates. Institutions faced with likely failure to meet the central goals of endowment management need to consider reducing spending levels or increasing expected portfolio returns.In contrast to the average institution’s high probability of failing to achieve endowment goals, institutions that follow sensible investment and spending policies face much better probabilities of success. For example, Yale has a long history of implementing well-articulated, disciplined policies. The university currently projects a 5 percent probability of a disruptive spending drop (as opposed to nearly 20 percent for the broader universe of institutions) and a 15 percent probability of purchasing power impairment (as opposed to 40 percent for the broader universe). Superior investment and spending policies lead to dramatically higher chances for success.Endowment spending policies balance the competing objectives of providing substantial stable budgetary flows to benefit today’s scholars and preserving portfolio assets to support tomorrow’s academicians. Responsible fiduciaries face the challenging task of evaluating the ability of investment and spending policies to meet the long-term goal of purchasing power preservation and the intermediate-term goal of stable operating budget support. Employing the tools of portfolio construction and spending rules, trustees ultimately select policies based on preferences regarding the trade-off between the central goals of endowment management.PURCHASING POWER EVALUATIONPreserving purchasing power requires that each individual gift to endowment forevermaintain its ability to “support a specific set of activities.” In aggregate, then, after deducting spending distributions, endowment assets must grow by the rate of educational inflation and increase by the amount of new gifts.Appropriate measurement of inflation allows institutions to assess the continuing ability to consume a basket of goods and services peculiar to higher education. Since expenses of colleges and universities differ dramatically from those of individuals, and from those of the economy as a whole, inflation measures appropriate to individuals (the Consumer Price Index) or the broad economy (the GNP deflator) work poorly for higher education.The Higher Education Price Index (HEPI) measures costs specific to educational institutions. Heavily weighted toward salaries and other personnel costs, over its forty-six-year history HEPI advanced at a rate approximately 1.4 percent per annum in excess of the GNP deflator. Lack of productivity gains in education accounts for the greater inflation in academic costs. A labor-intensive enterprise, teaching cannot be made more efficient without impairing the process. For example, applying technology by using video terminals to replace in-person lectures improves productivity in a superficial sense, but diminishes the educational experience. Likewise, increasing class sizes improves productivity, but undoubtedly reduces quality at the same time. As long as productivity gains disproportionately accrue to the rest of the economy, costs for higher education can be expected to grow at a rate higher than the general level of inflation.Yale’s Endowment Purchasing PowerFigure 3.2 illustrates the Yale endowment’s purchasing power from 1950 to 2006. The analysis begins in 1950, because prior to that date the university lacks clean data on gifts, spending, and investment performance. Throughout much of the twentieth century, financial statements recorded only book values of financial assets, providing little information for students of markets. Unit accounting, which enables institutions to distinguish between various inflows and outflows, gained wideacceptance only in the early 1970s, causing earlier data to be disentangled only with great difficulty.Purchasing power analysis starts with the 1950 endowment value and subsequent inflation rates. Increasing the 1950 portfolio value by the amount of inflation in each subsequent year creates a series of purchasing power targets. Since gifts “enlarge the scope of activities” supported by endowment, each year the purchasing power target increases by the amount of new gifts, which in subsequent years undergo a similar adjustment for inflation.Note the importance of new gifts to the endowment, with nearly three-quarters of 2006’s targeted value stemming from gifts made since 1950. In other words, in the absence of new gifts over the preceding fifty-six years, Yale’s 2006 endowment would likely total only about one-quarter of its actual value.Figure 3.2 Endowment Values Vastly Exceed 1950 Purchasing Power TargetYale University Endowment Growth, 1950–2006Sources: Yale Financial Statements. Higher Education Price Index data from Research Associates of Washington.A comparison of actual endowment values with targeted levels illustrates the degree of success in meeting purchasing power goals. Based on the difference between the June 30, 2006 market value of $18.0 billion and the purchasing power goal of $6.7 billion, Yale succeeded admirably in increasing asset values.III Yet the bottom line success includes periods in which the overall picture appeared far less rosy.The 1950s witnessed a rough balance between endowment growth and purchasing power preservation, with a surplus of approximately 17 percent shown by 1959. After keeping pace through most of the 1960s, the endowment began to suffer as inflationary pressures grew, setting the stage for serious problems to come. During the 1970s, disastrous markets for financial assets and high inflation caused the endowment to end the decade 56 percent below its target level. By 1982, Yale’s endowment reached a low point, with assets representing only 42 percent of the targeted purchasing power goal. Fortunately, the 1980s bull market reversed the problems of the 1970s, ultimately allowing the 1994 endowment to achieve the targeted level of the 1950 endowment inflated and adjusted for gifts. Extraordinary market returns subsequently boosted the June 30, 2006 endowment to a 170 percent surplus over the target.Recent dramatic increases in endowment purchasing power cause some to question whether by accumulating assets, Yale’s fiduciaries favor future generations of scholars at the expense of the current generation. While the question of the appropriate spending level generates spirited debate, the current increase in assets results from a combination of strong markets and reasonable spending rules, creating a cushion that will be drawn down in tough times to come.Dramatic swings in purchasing power relative totargeted levels come as little surprise to veteran market observers. In 1982, Yale’s endowment registered a nearly 60 percent deficit versus the desired level. Twenty-four years later, the portfolio shows a 170 percent surplus. Even though market swings cause institutions to feel alternately poor and rich, sensible portfolio managers base investment and spending decisions on assumptions regarding long-term capital market characteristics. Evaluating purchasing power preservation requires appreciation of the positive and negative consequences of market volatility, considered within the perspective of a distinctly long time frame.Human nature reacts to unexpectedly handsome investment returns by looking for ways to consume newfound wealth. Responding to strong markets by increasing spending rates creates the potential for long-term damage to endowment. First, increases in the rate of spending following extraordinary investment returns put the institution at risk of consuming part of the cushion designed to protect against a less robust future. Second, increases in spending soon become part of an institution’s permanent expense base, reducing operational flexibility. If the rate of spending rises in a boom, an institution facing a bust loses the benefit of a cushion and suffers the burden of a greater budgetary base.Target spending rates sit at the center of fiscal discipline, leading responsible fiduciaries to alter rates with great reluctance. Rather than seeing strong recent performance as an encouragement to increase payouts, skeptical managers wonder about the sustainability of past good fortune and prepare for the possibility of a less rewarding future. Only fundamental improvements in an institution’s investment and spending policies justify altering target spending rates.Evaluating maintenance of purchasing power requires an extremely long time horizon. Reacting to a decade of disastrous losses by reducing payout formulas or responding to a decade of extraordinary returns by increasing distribution rates may harm the academic enterprise. Bear market–induced cuts in programs and bull market–driven expansions of offerings needlessly buffet the institution, causing the endowment to fail in its mission of buffering university operations from financial market volatility. Responsible fiduciaries look past the inevitable short-run swings in endowment value caused by market gyrations, keeping attention firmly focused on the long-run preservation of asset purchasing power.SPENDING SUSTAINABILITY EVALUATIONStewards of endowment assets strive to provide a substantial, sustainable flow of resources to support the academic enterprise. In Tobin’s words, to “support the same set of activities” throughout time, distributions must grow by at least the rate of inflation for the goods and services consumed by endowed institutions. When new gifts “enlarge the scope of activities,” distributions from endowment must increase to support and sustain the new activities.In contrast to the long-term nature of the purchasing power preservation goal, providing a sustainable flow of support to the operating budget constitutes an intermediate-term objective.

Since large fluctuations inassets, by determining the portfolio allocation, and the specification of liabilities, by defining the spending policy. The lack of constraints on investment and spending strategies provides great flexibility for fiduciaries, increasing the likelihood of meeting institutional goals.Foundations exercise complete control over asset-allocation policies, similar to the flexibility enjoyed by educational institutions. On the spending side, however, foundations must achieve a minimum payout of five percent of assets to support charitable purposes, or face tax penalties. The mandated distribution level causes foundations to face an investment problem materially different from the challenge facing educational endowment managers.While academic institutions benefit enormously from high levels of endowment distributions, in the event of a serious disruption in endowment support other revenue sources play a compensating role in the budgetary base. Endowment distributions generally support only a modest portion of educational institution operating budgets, with major research universities relying on endowment payout to fund an average of 12.5 percent of expenditures.7 For most such institutions, a significant decrease in spending from endowment poses difficult problems, but fails to threaten institutional viability.Foundations rely almost exclusively on investment income to support operations. In 2006, eight of the ten largest grant-making foundations received essentially 100 percent of total revenues from investment portfolios. Even though grant programs grow and shrink somewhat more readily than academic operations, foundations require reasonably stable flows of funds to avoid disruption, particularly when activities involve multiyear commitments. The great reliance of foundations on distributions from investment assets calls for structuring portfolios with lower risk profiles.Colleges and universities benefit from the generosity of alumni and friends, with gifts providing an important source of support for academic programs. In difficult times, inflows from donors serve to dampen shortfalls in endowment support for operations. In prosperous times, gifts allow educational institutions to expand the scope of their activities. Over time, the cumulative impact of giving makes an enormous difference to colleges and universities.The Impact of GiftsThe experience of Harvard, Yale, and the Carnegie Institution over the course of the twentieth century provides insight into the importance of donor support. The Carnegie Institution of Washington, one of Andrew Carnegie’s many philanthropies, pursues pure, cutting-edge scientific research in astronomy, plant biology, embryology, global ecology, and earth sciences. Carnegie established the Institution in 1902 with a $10 million gift, increased the endowment by a further $2 million in 1907, and added $10 million in 1911. Carnegie’s $22 million endowment nearly equaled Harvard’s 1910 fund balance of $23 million and vastly exceeded Yale’s $12 million.Over the course of nearly a century, the Carnegie Institution endowment more than kept pace with inflation, with June 30, 2006 assets of $720 million comfortably ahead of the $490 million needed to match the rise in price levels. But the formerly comparableHarvard endowment, with a June 30, 2006 value of $29.2 billion, and the previously smaller Yale endowment, with a value of $18.0 billion, dwarf the Carnegie fund. While differences in investment and spending policies no doubt explain some of the gap, the absence of gift inflows constitutes the fundamental reason for Carnegie’s failure to keep pace with Yale and Harvard.In desiring to supply a stable flow of operating income, hoping to exist forever and wishing to comply with minimum IRS distribution requirements, foundation fiduciaries face a fundamentally conflicting set of goals. Without a safety net of external sources of support, foundations feel the impact of poor investment results. Short-term stability in distributions argues for a less volatile portfolio, while long-run maintenance of purchasing power and high payout rates point toward a higher risk allocation. Foundations generally opt for lower risk portfolios, sensibly providing stable flows of resources to support the institutional mission. As a result, the foundation community spends at rates inconsistent with preservation of capital, suggesting that in the long run the role of most foundations will diminish as purchasing power erodes.In spite of superficial similarities, endowments and foundations differ in important ways, including the amount of control over spending streams, the degree of programmatic reliance on portfolio distributions, and the availability of continuing external support. While endowments and foundations share some important characteristics, dissimilarities between the two types of funds lead to articulation of meaningfully different purposes and goals. That investment objectives of such closely related organizations differ so significantly highlights the importance of careful consideration of the relationship between investment funds and institutional objectives. Understanding the raison d’etre of a fund and expressing the related institutional aspirations serve as an important starting point in the fund’s management process.THE SKEPTICAL VIEWPOINTIn a healthy academic community, controversy abounds. In the case of endowments, debate generally revolves around intergenerational issues, with some current beneficiaries suggesting that endowment payout levels provide insufficient support for university operations.Henry Hansmann, the Augustus E. Lines Professor of Law at Yale Law School, questions the advisability of any endowment accumulation, raising issues that go far beyond the question of appropriate payout rates. In an August 2, 1998 New York Times interview, Hansmann suggests that “a stranger from Mars who looks at private universities would probably say they are institutions whose business is to run large pools of investment assets and that they run educational institutions on the side that can expand and contract to act as buffers for investment pools.”8 Hansmann suggests that trustees pursue a “real objective” of accumulating a large and growing endowment, viewing the educational operations as a constraint to unfettered financial asset accumulation. Administrators and faculty seek endowments to provide job security, a light workload, and a pleasant physical environment, while alumni focus on reputational capital, hoping to bask in the reflected glory of a wealthyeducational institution.In a paper entitled “Why Do Universities Have Endowments?” Hansmann uses the experience of the 1960s and 1970s to bolster his argument. He notes the “financial crisis of the 1970s” damaged higher education as “private demand declined, government support abruptly stopped its former upward trajectory, and energy costs increased dramatically.”9 Recognizing that universities found themselves squeezed between costs that were continuing to rise and income sources that were shrinking, Hansmann observes “little affirmative evidence that universities have viewed their endowments principally as buffers for their operating budgets.”10Yale’s Endowment BufferAn analysis of the behavior of Hansmann’s own institution belies his claims. His employer, Yale University, used endowment spending policy to dampen growth in the boom times of the 1960s and to cushion the financial trauma of the 1970s. During the decade of the 1960s, Yale released an average of 4.4 percent of the endowment to support the academic enterprise. Strong budgetary results and superior investment performance accompanied endowment distributions that provided support at levels consistent with long-term sustainability.In contrast, during the 1970s, spending from endowment averaged 6.3 percent, as Yale sought to offset, at least in part, the impact of hostile economic forces. Despite following a policy that released support for the operating budget at unsustainable rates, Yale posted deficits in every year of the decade. The policy of “leaning against the wind” cost the endowment dearly, as the purchasing power of assets declined by more than 60 percent between 1968 and 1982, in spite of the infusion of substantial amounts of new gifts.The historical record indicates that Yale uses endowment assets to shield the operating budget from disruptive fluctuations in income streams. Sustainable spending rates in the range of 3.8 percent to 4.4 percent in the 1950s, 1960s, 1980s and 1990s correspond to reasonably stable operating environments. In contrast, the deficit-plagued 1970s saw spending peak at the stunning rate of 7.4 percent in 1971. Without extraordinary endowment support in the 1970s, Yale’s operational troubles would have been magnified, perhaps causing long-term damage to the institution.Not only does historical experience suggest that Yale employed endowment assets to insulate academic programs from economic stress, but the very nature of the university’s spending policy places budgetary stability in a prominent place. Each year Yale spends 80 percent of last year’s spending adjusted for inflation plus 20 percent of the targeted long-term spending rate applied to the previous year’s endowment market value adjusted for inflation. By emphasizing budgetary stability, the university expresses a strong preference for using the endowment to reduce the impact of financial shocks.Spending Policy ExtremesExamining Yale’s spending decisions in the context of policy extremes favoring, on the one hand, spending stability and, on the other hand, endowment preservation, highlights the university’s substantial bias toward providing reliable support for operations. Ifuniversities treat academic operations as a sideshow to endowment accumulation, spending distributions would correspond to levels consistent with maintenance of asset purchasing power. In the extreme case, institutions would distribute only returns in excess of inflation, placing preservation of investment assets above even a modicum of stability in supporting academic programs. At the other end of the spectrum, if universities focus exclusively on consistent payouts from endowment, spending would rise with inflation, tracing a pattern independent of fluctuations in the market value of endowment assets.Figure 3.4A illustrates the spending patterns resulting from two extreme spending policies using market returns from the 1960s and 1970s. The first panel shows the constant flows from maintaining inflation-adjusted spending, while the second depicts the volatile flows from maintaining inflation-adjusted endowment values. Note that an exclusive focus on endowment purchasing power stability fails to allow any distribution to support operations in more than one-half of the simulated periods.Figure 3.4B shows the impact of the extreme spending policies on endowment levels. Pursuing stable spending flows, as illustrated in the first panel, produces enormous volatility in real endowment values. In contrast, preserving endowment purchasing power promotes stability in asset values, as depicted by the relatively smooth pattern in the second panel.Policies designed to provide a constant level of inflation-adjusted support for operations, illustrated in the top panels of Figures 3.4A and 3.4B, depend on benign financial markets to operate successfully. Consider the dramatically different results from simulations conducted using financial data from the 1960s and the 1970s.The 1960s provided substantial rewards to investors. Stocks returned 7.8 percent per annum and bonds 3.5 percent in an environment where inflation grew by only 2.5 percent. Investors pursuing stable spending policies did little damage to endowments, causing a purchasing power decline of only around 10 percent.In contrast, economic and financial conditions in the 1970s posed grave threats to endowed institutions, as high inflation and poor marketable securities returns exacted a terrible toll. Inflation, consuming 7.4 percent annually, exceeded returns on domestic stocks at 5.9 percent per annum, bonds at 7.0 percent, and cash at 6.3 percent. Investors found no place to hide. Simulations show that in 1970, if a traditional portfolio followed a stable spending policy, more than 60 percent of the purchasing power of a fund evaporated by the end of the decade.Policies focused solely on endowment preservation, shown in the middle panels of Figures 3.4A and 3.4B, failed to release any distribution to the operating budget in twelve of the twenty years between 1960 and 1979, highlighting the impracticality of a single-minded focus on asset protection. Even in the hospitable environment of the 1960s, investment results provided no support for current operations in three of ten years. So hostile were the 1970s that even with only one meaningful distribution to the budget, stable endowment policies failed to preserve assets, as purchasing power declined by nearly 24 percent.Figure 3.4A: Spending Flow Comparison IllustratesImpact of Extreme PoliciesStable Spending Policy Simulation Provides Consistent Inflation-Adjusted Budgetary Support Spending Flows, 1960–1979 Spend 5% of Market Value, Increased by InflationNote: Data are adjusted for inflation.

Hypothetical portfolio has a starting value $1000 and is readjusted to an asset allocation of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds yearly. Actual Yale experience is indexed to 1000 in 1960 to facilitate comparison with the simulations, but includes the impact of new gifts while simulations do not.Yale’s policies, as reflected in spending flows and endowment levels depicted in the bottom panel of the figures, track the stable spending policy much more closely than the stable endowment policy. Similar to other endowed institutions, in the 1970s Yale experienced an extraordinary decline in endowment purchasing power asthe institution sought to supply flows of funds to support the university’s academic mission. By spending at unsustainably high rates, purchasing power of assets declined dramatically, dropping more than 40 percent during the 1970s. Yale’s actions belie Hansmann’s suggestion that endowment preservation dominates institutional thinking.CONCLUSIONInvestment and spending policies support the purposes for which educational institutions accumulate endowments, providing the framework for producing enhanced stability, increased independence, and greater excellence. By achieving the long-term goal of purchasing power preservation and the intermediate-term goal of substantial, stable budgetary support, colleges and universities meet economist James Tobin’s requirement that an endowment “continue to support the set of activities that it is now supporting.”11Fiduciaries face a challenge in balancing the conflicting goals of preserving assets and supporting current operations. Spending policies resolve the tension by specifying the relative importance of sensitivity to current endowment market values (contributing to asset preservation) and sensitivity to past spending levels (contributing to stable budgetary support). The target spending rate plays an important role in determining a fund’s ability to meet the objective of intergenerational equity, with too-high rates favoring current scholars and toolow rates favoring tomorrow’s.Donors to endowment expect to provide permanent support to a designated activity, requiring endowment managers to maintain each specific fund’s ability to purchase the associated goods and services throughout time. Rates of inflation faced by educational institutions exceed general price-level increases since human-resource-dependent academic enterprises generally fail to achieve productivity gains, increasing the difficulties inherent in maintaining endowment purchasing power. New gifts fail to relieve the pressure to maintain asset values, as contributions to endowment expand the set of activities funded by an institution’s permanent funds and enlarge the size of the portfolio to be preserved.The process of articulating purposes and defining goals benefits fund managers of all stripes, leading to substantially different conclusions for different investors. In the case of institutions as similar as endowments and foundations, differences in institutional character cause purposes to vary. Variations in operating environments lead to expression of different investment goals that accommodate the particular institution’s specific opportunities and constraints.By providing the ultimate test against which to measure the desirability of various investment and spending policies, investment goals serve as an essential foundation for the funds’ management process. Investment objectives influence the philosophical tenets that underlie the creation of investment portfolios, generating important guidance for fund managers. Investors evaluate combinations of portfolio asset allocations and spending policies in terms of ability to meet institutional goals, placing articulation of portfolio objectives at the heart of the investment process.4
Investment Philosophy
Successful investors articulate coherent investment philosophies, consistently applied to
all aspects of the portfolio management process. Philosophical principles represent time-
tested insights into investment matters that rise to the level of enduring professional
convictions. The central tenets of an investor's approach to markets emanate from
fundamental beliefs regarding the most effective means to generate investment returns to
satisfy institutional goals.
Investment returns stem from decisions regarding three tools of portfolio
management: asset allocation, market timing, and security selection. Investor behavior
determines the relative importance of each aspect of portfolio management, with careful
investors consciously constructing portfolios to reflect the expected contribution of each
portfolio management tool.
Asset allocation, the starting point for portfolio construction, involves defining the
asset classes that constitute the portfolio and determining the proportion of the fund that
resides in each class. Typical institutional asset classes include domestic equities, foreign
equities, fixed income, absolute return, real assets, and private equities. The policy
portfolio describes the target allocation to each of the asset classes employed by the fund.
Market timing consists of short-run deviation from the long-term policy targets. For
example, assume that a fund's long-term targets are 50 percent stocks and 50 percent
bonds. A fund manager who identifies stocks as temporarily cheap and bonds as
temporarily expensive might tactically weight the portfolio 60 percent to stocks and 40
percent to bonds. The return resulting from the overweighting of stocks and
underweighting of bonds constitutes the return attributable to market timing.
Security selection derives from active management of individual asset classes. If a
manager creates portfolios that faithfully replicate the markets (i.c., passive portfolios),
that manager makes no active bets. To the extent that a portfolio differs from the
composition of the overall market, active management accounts for a portion of
investment results. For example, the security selection return for the U.S. equity asset class
would be the difference between returns from the U.S. equity portfolio's securities and
returns from the overall domestic equity market, as defined by a benchmark index of U.S.
equities, such as the Wilshire 5000.
The Role of Asset Allocation
Many investors believe that a law of finance dictates that policy allocation decisions
dominate portfolio returns, relegating market timing and security selection actions to
secondary status. In a 2000 study, Roger Ibbotson and Paul Kaplan survey a number of
articles on the contribution of asset allocation to investment returns. The authors note
that "[o]n average, policy accounted for a little more than all of total return," implying
that security selection and market timing make no material contribution to returns.¹ In
another nod to the centrality of the asset-allocation decision, Ibbotson and Kaplan
conclude that "... approximately 90 percent of the variability of a fund's return across
time is explained by the variability of policy returns."
"2
Investors often treat asset allocation's central role in determining portfolio returns as a
truism. It is not. The Ibbotson and Kaplan study describes investor behavior, not finance
theory. Imagine a buy-and-hold portfolio consisting of one (particularly idiosyncratic)
stock-portfolio returns follow largely from security selection. Or, consider the strategy
of aggressively day trading bond futures-market timing dominates returns.
Obviously, institutional portfolio managers usually buy more than one stock and
rarely pursue aggressive day trading strategies. Instead, investors hold broadly diversified
portfolios and avoid market timing, leaving asset allocation to determine investment
results. Given the difficulties in timing markets and the challenges of security selection,
such behavior provides a rational foundation for investment management. By avoiding
extreme allocation shifts and holding diversified portfolios, investors cause asset allocation
to account for the largest share of portfolio returns.
Recognizing that decisions regarding the relative importance of asset allocation,
market timing, and security selection lie within an investor's purview serves as an
important starting point for policymakers. Instead of passively accepting the
overwhelming importance of asset allocation, knowledgeable investors consider each
source of return as a significant independent factor. Ultimately, in articulating a
philosophy regarding the respective roles of asset allocation, market timing, and security
selection, investors determine the fundamental character of the investment management
process.
By choosing to place asset allocation at the center of the investment process, investors
ground the decision-making framework on the stable foundation of long-term policy
actions. Focus on asset allocation relegates market timing and security selection decisions
to the background, reducing the degree to which investment results depend on mercurial,
unreliable factors.
Selecting the asset classes for a portfolio constitutes a critically important set of
decisions, contributing in large measure to a portfolio's success or failure. Identifying
appropriate asset classes requires focus on functional characteristics, considering potential
to deliver returns and to mitigate portfolio risk. Commitment to an equity bias enhances
returns, while pursuit of diversification reduces risks. Thoughtful, deliberate focus on
asset allocation dominates the agenda of long-term investors.
The principles of equity ownership and diversification underlie asset allocation
deliberations of serious long-term investors. Both historical experience and finance theory
point to the conclusion that owning equities provides higher returns than owning bonds.
Investors seeking to generate high rates of return naturally gravitate toward substantial
allocations to equity assets. At the same time, risks associated with concentrating
portfolios in a single asset type give investors pause, causing prudent market participants
to diversify portfolio exposures. Expressing an equity bias and maintaining appropriate
diversification provide the foundation for building strong investment portfolios.
The Role of Market Timing
Market timing, according to Charles Ellis, represents a losing strategy. "There is no
evidence of any large institutions having anything like consistent ability to get in when the
market is low and get out when the market is high. Attempts to switch between stocks
and bonds, or between stocks and cash, in anticipation of market moves have been
unsuccessful much more often than they have been successful."3
Market timing causes portfolio characteristics to deviate from those embodied in the
policy portfolio, producing inevitable differences in risk and return attributes. If market
timers bet against the stock market by reducing equity holdings and increasing cash
positions, long-run expected portfolio returns decline as the market timer's position
decreases risk levels. Because such activity lowers anticipated returns, market timers must
succeed substantially more than 50 percent of the time to post a winning record. The
wind in the speculator's face, combined with transactions costs and market impact,
provide a high hurdle for those who would beat the market by holding abnormally high
cash positions.
If market timers increase the risk profile of a portfolio by overweighting a risky asset at
the expense of lower-risk positions, fiduciaries must consider the advisability of moving
risk beyond policy portfolio levels. If riskier portfolios produce characteristics consistent
with institutional goals, portfolio managers ought to consider adopting a higher risk
policy portfolio. If the market timer's enhanced risk gives fiduciaries pause, then prudence
demands rejecting even temporary moves to increase risk. Serious investors avoid timing
markets.
The Role of Security Selection
In efficient markets, active portfolio management, like market timing, tends to detract
from aggregate investment performance. In the context of relative performance, security
selection constitutes a zero-sum game. Since IBM (and every other tradeable stock)
represents a finite, measurable proportion of the market value of the U.S. equity market,
an investor can only hold an overweight position in IBM when other investors hold a
corresponding underweight position in IBM. The active manager who overweights IBM
creates market impact and incurs transaction costs in establishing the position; on the
other side of the trade are other active managers who underweight IBM, incurring those
same transactions costs and creating that same market impact. Only one of those
positions can be right in light of IBM's subsequent performance. Measured by the change
in IBM's price relative to the market, the amount by which the winners win equals the
amount by which the losers lose. Since active managers pay a high price to play the game,
in the aggregate active investors will lose by the amount of manager fees, transactions
costs, and market impact.
In less efficient markets, active management produces potentially sizable rewards. In
overwhelming importance of asset allocation, knowledgeable investors consider each
source of return as a significant independent factor. Ultimately, in articulating a
philosophy regarding the respective roles of asset allocation, market timing, and security
selection, investors determine the fundamental character of the investment management
process.

in the aggregate active investors will lose by the amount of manager fees, transactions
costs, and market impact.
In less efficient markets, active management produces potentially sizable rewards. In
fact, passive replication of benchmark returns proves impossible in private markets, such
as venture capital, leveraged buyouts, real estate, timber, and oil and gas. Even were the
market return obtainable, investors would almost certainly prefer to pursue more selective
approaches. When examined over reasonably long periods of time, in aggregate, illiquid
asset classes generally produce mediocre returns relative to less risky marketable security
alternatives.
An inverse relationship exists between efficiency in asset pricing and appropriate
degree of active management. Passive management strategies suit highly efficient markets,
such as U.S. Treasury bonds, where market returns drive results and active management
adds little or nothing. Active management strategies fit inefficient markets, such as private
equity, where market returns contribute very little to ultimate results and investment
selection provides the fundamental source of return.
Market participants willing to accept illiquidity achieve a significant edge in seeking
high risk-adjusted returns. Because market players routinely overpay for liquidity, serious
investors benefit by avoiding overpriced liquid securities and by embracing less liquid
alternatives.
Pursuit of value-oriented strategies enhances opportunities to achieve security
selection success. Value can either be purchased, by identifying assets trading at below fair
value, or created, by bringing unusual skills to improve corporate operations. Value
investors s operate with a margin of safety unavailable to less conservative investors.
The degree of active management opportunity in various asset classes provides
important input into the portfolio management process. Emphasizing inefficiently priced
asset classes with interesting active management opportunities increases the odds of
investment success. Intelligent acceptance of illiquidity and a value orientation constitute
a sensible, conservative approach to portfolio management.
In structuring portfolios, investors make choices, either explicitly or implicitly,
regarding the respective roles of asset allocation, market timing, and security selection. A
strong portfolio management framework rests on asset allocation decisions and
incorporates a bias toward equity assets with an appropriate level of diversification. Since
market timing actions generally prove unrewarding and always cause portfolios to deviate
from desired characteristics, serious investors avoid market timing. Security selection
decisions, while extremely difficult to execute with consistent success, contain the
potential to add value to portfolio returns. Investors enhance opportunity for beating the
market by pursuing excess returns where the degree of opportunity appears largest, by
accepting reasonable degrees of illiquidity, and by maintaining a value orientation.
ASSET ALLOCATION
Equity Bias
Sensible investors approach markets with a strong equity bias, since accepting the risk of
owning equities rewards long-term investors with higher returns. High returns contribute
mightily to meeting the goals of preservation of purchasing power and of provision of
sustainable operating budget support. In fact, the tension between the conflicting goals of
preserving assets and spending for operations can be relaxed only by increasing
investment returns.
Finance theory posits that acceptance of greater risk leads to the reward of higher
expected returns. In a happy coincidence, historical capital markets data, collected by
Roger Ibbotson and Rex Sinquefield, support the theoretical conclusion. Consider the
wealth multiples for investments in various U.S. asset classes and inflation outlined in
Table 4.1.

Historical Evidence
The data indicate that a dollar invested in Treasury bills at the end of 1925, with all
income reinvested, would have grown eighteen times by December 31, 2005. At first
glance, having multiplied the original investment by a factor of 18 appears satisfactory.
However, given that more than 60 percent of the increase would have been lost to
inflation, the result loses some luster. The low return of Treasury bills should not come as
a surprise. On at least two measures Treasury bills have been close to risk free. Investors
face virtually no credit exposure, as the U.S. government represents, perhaps, the most
creditworthy entity in the world. In addition, Treasury bills have provided a hedge against
inflation, with returns that closely track price increases. The price of these attractive
characteristics has been an extremely low real return. Thus, at least with twenty-twenty
hindsight, Treasury bills would not have been an appropriate investment for an
institution investing to earn substantial after-inflation returns.
Moving farther out the risk spectrum, the same dollar invested in longer-term
government bonds at the end of 1925 would have multiplied 71 times by the end of 2005.
Government bonds share with Treasury bills extremely high credit quality. Unlike
shorter-term instruments, however, bonds have a highly uncertain real return. Twenty-
year bonds, which are used in the Ibbotson-Sinquefield analysis, face two decades of
inflation rates, unknown and unknowable at the time of purchase. Not only do real
returns vary greatly, nominal returns also fluctuate over holding periods of less than the
term-to-maturity. The higher risks of longer-term bonds have been rewarded with higher
returns, although such returns fail to provide meaningful support for an institution that
consumes only after-inflation returns.
Corporate bonds provide an alternative to investment in government securities. Over
the eighty-year period, corporate bonds provided a wealth multiple of 100, exceeding the
multiple of 71 for default-free government bonds. The incremental return reflects
compensation for credit risk and call risk embodied in corporate obligations. In essence,
high-grade corporate bonds are a hybrid instrument, combining bond-like characteristics
with some equity risk and some optionality.
The 18 multiple for investing in Treasury bills, the 71 multiple for investing in
Treasury bonds and the 100 multiple for investing in corporate bonds represent long-
term rewards for lending money. Loans are relatively low risk assets. In the case of
Treasury obligations, the full faith and credit of the United States Government stand
behind the commitment to pay interest and return principal in a timely manner. In the
case of corporate bonds, the instruments have a senior claim on the assets of a
corporation. That is, payments on bonds take precedence over distributions to the owners
of a company, its equity holders.
Obviously, as residual claimants, equity holders face substantially greater risks than do
bondholders. In extreme cases, when corporations fail to meet fixed obligations, equity
owners may be wiped out. In spite of (or, perhaps, because of) these risks, in the United
States, over long periods of time equities have outperformed bonds by impressive
margins.
A dollar invested in common stock at the end of 1925 would have multiplied 2,658-
fold during the eighty-year holding period. An enormous difference exists between the
return expected from the conservative investment in cash (18 times) or government bonds
(71 times) and that expected from taking the greater risk in owning equity securities
(2,658 times).
The long-term benefits of owning equities increase as investments move farther out
the risk continuum. When investors assume the risk of investing in smaller capitalization
equities, the dollar grows 13,706 times during the period, a staggering amount relative to
returns for other asset classes. While some controversy surrounds the methodology used
by Ibbotson-Sinquefield's measurement of returns for small stocks, their work gives a
sense of the long-term rewards for accepting greater equity risk.
Although eighty years of Ibbotson-Sinquefield data show persuasive results, longer
periods of time produce even more dramatic conclusions. Wharton Professor Jeremy
Siegel, in his book Stocks for the Long Run, examines investment returns from[1802 to
2001. By using Ibbotson's recent data to extend Siegel's return series, over the more than
two centuries from 1802 to 2005, a dollar in the U.S. stock market grows to $10.3
million. During the same period, cash investments generate a multiple of only 4.8
thousand. The return-generating power of equity investment over long periods of time
dominates the multiples obtained by investing in bills and bonds as shown in Table 4.2.
As a footnote, gold "bugs" will be disappointed to learn that their favorite precious
metal returned a multiple of only 27, trailing by a large margin the returns of low risk
Treasury bills and only modestly exceeding the 16-fold impact of inflation.

These findings suggest that long-term investors maximize wealth by investing in high-
return, high-risk equity rather than buying debt instruments of governments and
corporations. As with many broad generalizations, this seemingly obvious conclusion
requires further examination.
...
Market studies focusing only on returns for securities in the United States miss
important information. Recent academic work by Will Goetzmann and Philippe Jorion
on investor experience in other countries reduces confidence in the long-run superiority
of equity investing. At the turn of the twentieth century, active stock markets existed in
Russia, France, Germany, Japan, and Argentina, all of which have been interrupted "
for a variety of reasons, including political turmoil, war, and hyper-inflation. Obviously,
these markets provide little grist for the mill of long-term capital market studies. Even the
most continuous of markets, those in the United States and United Kingdom, were shut
down for several months during World War I."5 Studies of long-term returns in the
United States ignore the fact that investors in foreign markets experienced less favorable
outcomes, with sometimes dramatically worse results.
In addition to the possibility that enthusiasm for equities might be based on parochial
experience, survivorship bias" inflates perceptions of historical returns. One study
suggests that "... the 5 percent real capital appreciation return on U.S. stocks is
exceptional, as other markets have typically returned 3 percent less than U.S. equities."
Were this conclusion to influence expectations for long-run equity returns, the case for
stock investments becomes considerably less compelling.
Ultimately, the argument for an equity bias in a long-term investment portfolio rests
on more than historical experience. Finance theory sensibly teaches that acceptance of
greater risk accompanies an expectation of greater return. While future stock market
returns might not be as robust as they have been for U.S. equity investors, long-term
investors will be well served with an equity bias.
Diversification
Even though market return studies indicate that high levels of equity market exposure
benefit long-term investors, the associated risks come through less clearly. Significant
concentration in a single asset class poses extraordinary risk to portfolio assets.
Fortunately, diversification provides investors with a powerful risk management tool. By
combining assets that vary in response to forces that drive markets, investors create more
efficient portfolios. At a given risk level, properly diversified portfolios provide higher
returns than less well diversified portfolios. Conversely, through appropriate
diversification, a given level of returns can be achieved at lower risk. Harry Markowitz,
pioneer of modern portfolio theory, maintains that portfolio diversification provides
investors with a "free lunch," since risk can be reduced without sacrificing expected
return.
Yale and the Eagle Bank
An extraordinary example of the risk in portfolio concentration comes from a
catastrophic event in the early history of the Yale endowment. An overwhelmingly large,
ill-advised investment in a single bank nearly bankrupted the college, with consequences
that lasted for decades.
In 1811, Yale College treasurer James Hillhouse and his illustrious colleagues, Eli
Whitney, William Woolsey, and Simeon Baldwin, acquired the charter for the formation
of the Eagle Bank of New Haven. At that time, only one other bank served New Haven's
healthy economy and developing merchant class. Hoping to pursue a mission of fostering
industry and commerce, at its opening the Eagle Bank commanded a significant level of
public confidence.
William Woolsey, a shrewd and experienced merchant and banker, served as the bank's
first president, returning to New Haven from a lucrative business career in New York as a
speculative sugar trader, hardware merchandizer, and merchant banker. With Woolsey at
the helm and a roster of New Haven's finest citizens as founders, the financial officers at
Yale were so convinced of the soundness of the bank that they applied for a special
dispensation from the State of Connecticut to invest more than the statutory limit of
$5,000 in the stock of any one bank. Yale not only invested far in excess of the limit, the
trustees also leveraged the college's investment with borrowed funds. In 1825, with the
exception of a few shares in municipal projects, the entire endowment was invested in the
Eagle Bank.
Sadly, Yale's confidence was misdirected. Upon William Woolsey's return to his
business ventures in New York in 1825, he selected George Hoadley, a Yale graduate,
practicing lawyer, and mayor of New Haven, to succeed him as bank president. The
founders of the bank were too busy with other endeavors to oversee Hoadley. In
September of 1825, after Hoadley had loaned out nearly the entire value of the bank in
inadequately collateralized loans, the bubble burst and the Eagle Bank declared
bankruptcy. Yale College lost over $21,000, bringing the total value of the endowment
down to $1,800. Unpaid debts for the college at the time amounted to well over $19,000,
causing Yale president Jeremiah Day to obtain emergency sources of financing. The
collapse of the bank was catastrophic to the City of New Haven, precipitating a
depression in the local economy. In disgrace, George Hoadley quietly moved to
Cleveland, where he finished out his days as a justice.
The Clark Foundation and Avon
While Yale's early nineteenth century portfolio exhibited unusual concentration, similar
situations exist today. Of the fifteen largest foundations in the United States, two (the
Lilly Endowment and the Starr Foundation) hold nearly all assets in a single stock,
another (the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation) holds well over half of assets in a single
stock, and yet another (the Annie E. Casey Foundation) holds over a quarter of assets in a
single stock. Oblivious to the measure of good fortune that contributed to the
undiversified portfolio's rise to the top of the charts, trustees use past success to justify
continuing to ntrate assets in one security. For each institution with a wildly
successful concentrated portfolio, any number of other institutions with undiversified
holdings languish in obscurity. Unfortunately, many single-stock foundations ultimately
experience the costs of holding radically undiversified portfolios.
Even when investors make good faith efforts to diversify, results sometimes disappoint.
In the early 1970s, trustees of the Edna McConnell Clark Foundation decided to reduce
exposure to Avon Products, the company that provided the wherewithal to establish the
institution. By selling shares of Avon to fund a diversified external equity manager, the
trustees hoped to reduce heavy dependence on the fortunes of a single security. The
timing of the decision made exquisite sense, as prices of Avon and other members of the
"Nifty Fifty" had climbed to unprecedented heights in an extraordinary bull market for
large-capitalization growth stocks.!!
The trustees chose J.P. Morgan to manage the portfolio, selecting the era's dominant
money management firm. Pursuing a strategy that had served the firm and its clients well,
Morgan promptly diversified the foundation's assets into other high quality growth
stocks. By exchanging one member of the "Nifty Fifty" for others of the same cohort, the
Clark Foundation's portfolio received little protection from the subsequent dramatic
collapse in quality growth stocks.
Yale's experience with a single security-shares of the Eagle Bank-and the Clark
Foundation's ill-fated investments in the Nifty Fifty provide cautionary tales regarding
portfolio concentration. True diversification requires owning assets that respond
differently to fundamental forces that drive markets.
Stocks and the Great Crash
Even broadly defined asset classes sometimes produce risks too great for investors to bear.
Consider the wealth multiples for small-cap stocks around the time of the Great Crash in
October 1929 shown in Table 4.3.
According to the data in Table 4.3, small stock prices peaked in November 1928. Had
a dollar been invested at the peak, it would have declined 54 percent by December 1929,
an additional 38 percent by December 1930, an additional 50 percent by December 1931,
and a final 32 percent by June 1932. From November 1928 to June 1932, market action
nearly destroyed the original investment. No investor, institutional or individual, could
tolerate the trauma. As market forces turned dollars into dimes, investors sold small-cap
stocks, placed the proceeds in Treasury bills, and swore never to invest in the equity
market again. Of course, selling equities in June of 1932 represented precisely the wrong
response. Ten cents invested at the depths of the Great Depression in small-capitalization
stocks would have grown more than 137,000 fold by December 31, 2005.

The sense of the skepticism with which investors viewed stocks in the 1930s runs
through Robert Lovett's "Gilt-Edged Insecurity," which appeared in the April 3, 1937
edition of The Saturday Evening Post. Lovett begins his examination of historical market
returns by suggesting that his readers "[c]onsider the absurdity of applying the word
security to a bond or a stock." Lovett's analysis showed that an investor buying "100
shares of each of the more popular stocks" at the turn of the century would have turned
nearly $295,000 into just $180,000 by the end of 1936. He concludes by warning his
readers to remember: "(1) that corporations... die easily and frequently; (2) to be extra
careful when everything begins to look good; (3) that you are buying risks and not
securities; (4) that governments break promises just as businesses do; and (5) that no
investments worth having are permanent."6 Lovett's commentary vividly illustrates why
so few investors came up with the dime to invest in small stocks in June of 1932.
Diversifying Strategies
Institutions generally respond to the risk in stocks by holding as much domestic equity as
tolerable, mitigating portfolio volatility by adding significant amounts of bonds and cash
to the mix. At June 30, 2005, the average educational endowment held 53 percent in
domestic equity, 23 percent in domestic fixed income, and 5 percent in cash, for a total of
81 percent in domestic marketable securities.7
The large concentration of assets in bonds and cash, with fully 28 percent of the
average portfolio in these low return assets, creates significant opportunity costs. Instead
of owning equity assets where dollars in the past eighty years grew more than 2,600-fold,
investors diversifying with fixed income assets held positions that grew 100-fold with
corporate bonds, 71-fold with Treasury bonds and 18-fold with cash.
The outsized exposure of more than 80 percent to securities of the U.S. market, with
fully half of assets invested in domestic equities, violates sensible diversification principles.
Committing more than fifty percent of a portfolio to a single asset type-domestic stocks
-exposes investors to unnecessary asset-concentration risk. The significant correlation
between domestic stocks and bonds further exacerbates the consequences of overreliance
on domestic equities. Interest rates play an important role in markets. Increasing rates
definitely cause bond prices to decline and may cause stock prices to decline, eliminating
or reducing the hoped for diversification effects. The converse also applies. Under many
circumstances, the average educational institution has more than four-fifths of the
portfolio driven in the same direction by the same economic factor.
By identifying high-return asset classes that show little correlation with domestic
marketable securities, investors achieve diversification without the opportunity costs of
investing in fixed income. The most common high-return diversifying strategy for a U.S.
investor involves adding foreign equities to the portfolio. Other possibilities include
venture capital, leveraged buyouts, real estate, timber, oil and gas, and absolute return. If
these asset classes provide high equity-like returns in a pattern that differs from the return
pattern of the core asset (U.S. domestic equities), investors create portfolios that offer
both high returns and diversification. Although on an asset-specific basis, higher expected
►
returns apparently come with the price of higher expected volatility, the lack of
correlation between individually risky asset classes actually reduces overall portfolio risk.
Diversification represents "a free lunch" that allows investors to reduce risk without
sacrificing expected returns.
The combination of an equity bias and appropriate diversification provides a powerful
underpinning for establishing policy asset allocation targets. Responding to the tenets of
equity bias and diversification, sensible institutions identify a variety of high expected
return assets that derive returns in ways fundamentally dissimilar from one another. By
spreading assets across a variety of asset types, investors diminish the risk that
undiversified exposure to a single market will cause significant damage and enhance the
possibility that well-diversified exposure to a variety of markets will generate high returns
with low levels of risk.
MARKET TIMING
Explicit market timing lies on the opposite end of the spectrum from disciplined
portfolio management. John Maynard Keynes, in a Kings College Investment Committee
memo, wrote that "the idea of wholesale shifts is for various reasons impracticable and
indeed undesirable. Most of those who attempt to, sell too late and buy too late, and do
both too often, incurring heavy expenses and developing too unsettled and speculative a
state of mind." Deliberate short-term deviations from long-term policy targets introduce
substantial risks to the investment process.
On the surface, arguments used to attack market timing sound uncomfortably similar
to those advanced when making asset allocation decisions. For example, investors might
reject market timing because it requires making a few focused, undiversifiable bets. Or,
investors might avoid market timing because of the insurmountable challenges in
identifying and predicting the multitude of variables that influence asset prices. While
similar factors influence both market timing and policy asset allocation, differences in
time frame clearly separate one from the other.
Market timing, defined as a short-term bet against long-term policy targets, requires
being right in the short run about factors that are impossible to predict in the short run.
Yet investors can reasonably deal with the important drivers of returns in the long run as
short-term anomalies disappear into predictable long-term patterns. Sensible investors
avoid concentrated bets against the institution's adopted asset allocation, thereby
eliminating the risk of inflicting serious damage by holding a portfolio inconsistent with
long-term objectives.
Tactical Asset Allocation
In the 1950s, many investors played a market timing game with stock and bond yields,
based on "... -practically an article of faith that good stocks must yield more income than
good bonds..." When dividend yields on stocks exceeded bond yields by a fair margin,
investors viewed stocks as attractive, overweighting equities relative to bonds. Conversely,
when bond yields neared stock yields, investors favored bonds. History provided a solid
foundation for the strategy. "Only for short periods in 1929, 1930, and 1933 [had] stocks
yielded less than government bonds."10 This valuation-based technique worked well until
1958, when stock yields last exceeded bond yields. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, as the
yield advantage of bonds increased relative to stocks, market timers became more invested
in fixed income and less invested in stocks. Of course, investors incurred significant
opportunity losses while futilely waiting for stock yields to signal a buying opportunity.
Ultimately, the failure of the relative yield market timing technique forced its
practitioners to identify an alternative form of employment.
A modern, somewhat more sophisticated version of the 1950s relative yield game,
tactical asset allocation (TAA), moves assets above and below policy weights based on
recommendations of a sophisticated quantitative model. After gaining institutional favor
based on strong performance during the crash of 1987, in subsequent years TAA's appeal
waned, as successes of the late 1980s faded from memory. Even though TAA's
recommendations stem from superficially sensible quantitative disciplines, the system
suffers from the faults of other market timing mechanisms.
A notable problem with standard three-way (stock, bond, and cash) TAA relates to the
resolution of model identified "mispricings." TAA models tend to prefer cash when
short-term interest rates equal or exceed long-term rates, that is in flat or inverted yield
curve environments. When TAA holds significant cash positions, investors receive
meaningful protection in environments where interest rates increase. The increase in rates
causes bond prices to decline and may cause stock prices to decline as well. (While the
relationship between stocks and bonds is complex, higher interest rates generally lead to
lower stock prices.) By holding cash, TAA practitioners protect portfolio assets from
interest-rate-induced declines in bond and stock prices.
In contrast, if investors hold cash as the yield curve moves down sharply, portfolios
might sustain irreversible opportunity losses. Downward shifts in the yield curve result
from bond rallies, which generally cause stocks to rally. TAA investors, stuck with
substantial cash positions, receive modest income returns while bonds and stocks post
significant gains. In this case, losses are irreversible in the sense that while cash originally
appeared to be the cheapest asset class, an across-the-board decline in interest rates
resolved cash's cheapness in a fashion that provided little benefit to holders of cash. In a
declining rate environment, handsome returns to holders of bonds and stocks make the
relatively paltry cash returns a bitter pill for TAA investors to swallow.
Because cash represents a poor asset class for investors with long time horizons, market
timing strategies employing cash pose particularly great dangers to endowment assets. If
investors mistakenly over-weight cash and underweight higher expected return assets,
subsequent rallies in long-term asset prices might cause permanent impairment of value.
While less severe damage may result from mistakes made in timing one high expected
return asset class relative to another, the ultimate consequences depend on disciplined
contrarian responses to initial market timing losses. Such discipline might be a lot to
expect from parties engaged in market timing in the first place.
Rebalancing and the 1987 Market Crash
While relatively few investors admit to explicit pursuit of market timing strategies, most
portfolios suffer from drift as market forces move actual allocations away from target
levels. Circumstances surrounding the market crash in 1987 illustrate the meaningful
costs incurred by failing to conduct disciplined rebalancing activity in the face of dramatic
market moves.
During the period surrounding the 1987 stock market collapse endowment portfolios
first exhibited aspects of disciplined rebalancing in the run up before the crash and then
showed signs of perverse market timing in the carnage of the crash. In June 1987, the
average endowment invested slightly more than 55 percent of assets in domestic equities
and committed almost 37 percent to bonds and cash." The 1987 mid-year allocations
marked the end of a period of extraordinary portfolio stability, as between 1985 and 1987
stock allocations ranged from 55.0 percent to 55.4 percent and fixed income allocations
ranged from 36.7 percent to 36.9 percent. It appears that in the two years prior to June
1987 endowment investors engaged in rebalancing activity, offsetting market price
movements. Since equities outperformed bonds by a margin of 70 percent to 25 percent
for the two-year period, only by leaning against the bull market wind could investors file
three consecutive fiscal year reports indicating essentially constant allocations to domestic
stocks and bonds.
After the October 1987 crash, portfolio stability disappeared as market forces drove
down allocations to stocks and pushed up allocations to bonds. Responding to the
collapse in stock prices with fear, the average endowment manager exacerbated the
market-induced dislocation by selling stocks. Reacting to the rally in high quality bond
prices with greed, the average endowment manager enhanced the market-induced
increases by purchasing more bonds. From June 1987 to June 1988, equity holdings
declined from 55.3 percent to 49.1 percent, more than can be explained by the market
drop during the year. Roughly offsetting the equity decline, fixed income increased from
36.7 percent to 41.9 percent, more than can be explained by the market rally. In
retrospect, educational institutions bought high and sold low, following a poor recipe for
investment success.
By reallocating more than 5 percent of assets from domestic stocks to bonds and cash
in the aftermath of the 1987 market crash, endowment investors incurred significant
opportunity costs as the market staged a reasonably rapid recovery. Even in the face of
stronger prices, fear of the U.S. stock market persisted, as endowment bond and cash
allocations remained above the pre-crash level until 1993. College and university
portfolios incurred substantial opportunity costs by maintaining lower risk portfolios for
years after the stock market crash.
One charitable interpretation of post-crash equity sales involves the possibility that
institutions inadvertently allowed equity allocations to drift above desired levels in the
strong stock market of the early 1980s. Perhaps the 1987 crash highlighted the degree to
which equities dominated institutional portfolios, causing fiduciaries to sell stocks to
reach a lower desired portfolio risk profile. If so, post-crash reductions in equity
allocations represent a belated, costly, inelegant response to excessive portfolio risk.
Another fundamental justification for reduced equity holdings stems from the
possibility that the 1987 crash caused investors to conclude that risk characteristics of
equities differed from previous assumptions. Perhaps past assessments of stock market
variability materially understated true risk. Maybe equity returns exhibit more frequent
extreme moves than market participants previously believed. Certainly, the
unprecedented market collapse forced investors to reassess the character of equity return
patterns, possibly contributing to a portfolio shift from equities to less risky assets.
Unfortunately for those seeking a reasonable explanation for institutional behavior,
increases in stock allocations during the 1990s argue against interpreting November and
December 1987 sales as a rational portfolio adjustment. Investors motivated by greed held
91-92/433
high allocations going into the crash, only to reduce holdings significantly thereafter. As
confidence returned, equity allocations began to rise, reversing the allocation decisions
made only a short time before. Educational institutions, greedy and fearful in turn,
damaged portfolios in their perverse response to the crash in October 1987.
With the benefit of hindsight, post-crash equity purchases made enormous sense,
enriching those with the courage to go against the crowd. In fact, the apparently easy
money made by buying common stocks in late 1987 encouraged investors to follow a
policy of "buying the dips" with increasing enthusiasm.
As the bull market continued its run through the 1990s, the public saw every modest
decline in stock prices as an opportunity to buy equities "on sale." Did investors learn an
important rebalancing lesson from the 1987 stock market crash, or did the relatively
quick rebound in prices point market participants in the wrong direction?
Drawing conclusions from the 1987 stock market crash about the easy profits gained
from "buying the dips" places far too much weight on a shaky foundation, since the
extraordinary circumstances surrounding the October break in markets constitute a
unique occurrence. The extreme one-day decline of 23 percent in the S&P 500 represents
a 25 standard deviation event, an occurrence so rare in a normally distributed variable that
it staggers the imagination. Basing future behavior on the 1987 crash and subsequent
market recovery exposes investors to the danger that less extreme market declines contain
far less information regarding future price behavior. While nearterm profitability of post-
crash equity purchases illustrate a positive aspect of rebalancing activity, investors face the
possibility of confusing the important risk control function of rebalancing with the
unreliable return-oriented activity of "buying the dips."
Excess Volatility
Yale economist Robert Shiller argues that markets exhibit excess volatility. ¹2 That is,
security prices tend to fluctuate more than necessary to respond to fundamental factors,
such as earnings and interest rates, that determine intrinsic value. In other words, "if price
movements were rescaled down... so as to be less variable, then price would do a better
job of forecasting fundamentals." Shiller's self-described "controversial claim" provides
"evidence of a failure of the efficient markets model."13 Anyone attempting to understand
October 1987's market crash from a fundamental perspective sees merit in Shiller's
position.
In a world with excess volatility, investors care about the direction of security price
fluctuations. Price declines provide opportunities to buy and price increases provide
opportunities to sell. Under some circumstances, following a significant decline in price
an asset actually becomes less risky, since it can be acquired more cheaply. The common-
sense conclusion of bottom-fishing investors contrasts with the statistician's conclusion
that a dramatic drop in price increases observed (historical) volatility, implying a higher
risk level for the asset. Of course, price volatility creates opportunity only when prices
change more than necessary to reflect changes in underlying fundamentals.
Real-Time Rebalancing
Frequent rebalancing activity allows investors to maintain a consistent risk profile and to
exploit return-generating opportunities created by excess security price volatility.
Moreover, real-time rebalancing tends to cost less, as trades generally prove
accommodating to the market. Frequent rebalancers buy in the face of immediate
declines and sell in the face of immediate increases, in both cases supplying liquidity for
traders pursuing the opposite, predominant tack. Although few investors commit the
time and resources necessary to conduct real-time rebalancing, an examination of the
benefits of intensive rebalancing provides context for understanding the value of the
strategy.
Consider Yale University's rebalancing activity. Yale possesses a number of advantages
unavailable to most investors. The university's endowment enjoys tax-exempt status,
allowing frequent trading without adverse tax consequences associated with realization of
gains. A sophisticated team of investment professionals manages the funds on a day-to-
day basis, providing the staff support needed for management-intensive activities. Yale's
special tax status and dedicated investment staff permit the university to engage in real-
time rebalancing activity.
Yale's trading activity during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003 provides some insight
into the potential magnitude of rebalancing profits. During the year, the U.S. equity
market, as measured by the Wilshire 5000, produced a total return of 1.3 percent.
Investors undertaking an annual review of portfolio allocations would likely do little to
rebalance domestic equity holdings (unless returns of other asset classes caused the
93-94/433 >
domestic equity allocation to change markedly). In fact, in Yale's case the overall portfolio
return for the fiscal year amounted to 8.8 percent, implying reasonable stability in
portfolio allocations and suggesting modest annual rebalancing requirements.
For Yale's fiscal 2003, the placid surface of the equity market concealed some powerful
undercurrents. Early in the fiscal year, markets collapsed. In July, the Wilshire 5000 posted
a peak-to-trough decline of more than 18 percent. The market subsequently rebounded,
nearly regaining the July peak in late August with a greater than 19 percent return. From
the August high the market once again fell, declining by more than 19 percent to what
proved the fiscal-year low on October 9th. The hidden currents continued to roil the
markets with a 21 percent increase by November followed by a 14 percent decrease
through March. A powerful surge lifted the market by nearly 27 percent to the fiscal-year
high in mid June, from which the market drifted down to close the twelve-month period
essentially where it started.
The stock market volatility provided numerous opportunities to execute rebalancing
trades. Every substantial drop and every meaningful increase allowed investors to buy the
dips and sell the peaks. During the university's fiscal 2003, rebalancing activity produced
a host of profit-generating transactions.
As a matter of course, at the beginning of every trading day Yale estimates the value of
each of the components of the endowment. When marketable securities asset classes
(domestic equity, foreign developed equity, emerging market equity, and fixed income)
deviate from target allocation levels, the university's investments office takes steps to
restore allocations to target levels. In fiscal year 2003, Yale executed approximately $3.8
billion in domestic equity rebalancing trades, roughly evenly split between purchases and
sales. Net profits from rebalancing amounted to approximately $26 million, representing
a 1.6 percent incremental return on the $1.6 billion domestic equity portfolio.
Even though rebalancing profits produce a nice bonus for investors, the fundamental
motivation for rebalancing concerns adherence to long-term policy targets. In the context
of a carefully considered policy portfolio, rebalancing maintains the desired risk level.
Generating profit while controlling risk represents an unbeatable combination.
Few institutions and even fewer individuals possess the resources to conduct daily
rebalancing of investment portfolios. Yet regardless of the frequency of rebalancing,
fidelity to asset allocation targets proves important as a means of risk control and valuable
as a tool for return enhancement. Thoughtful investors employ rebalancing strategies to
maintain policy asset allocation targets.
Investors hoping to profit in the short run from rebalancing trades face nearly certain
long-run disappointment. Over long periods of time, portfolios allowed to drift with
capital markets returns tend to contain ever increasing allocations to risky assets, as higher
returns cause riskier positions to crowd out other holdings. The fundamental purpose of
rebalancing lies in controlling risk, not enhancing return. Rebalancing trades keep
portfolios at long-term policy targets by reversing deviations resulting from asset class
performance differentials. Disciplined rebalancing activity requires a strong stomach and
serious staying power. Conducted in a significant bear market, rebalancing appears to be a
losing strategy as investors commit funds to assets showing continuing relative price
weakness.
Contrast the positive rebalancing experience of investors in 1987 or Yale's rebalancing
experience in 2003 with the fate suffered by investors in the bear market of 1973 and
1974. Price declines required purchases of equities, followed by further declines that
impaired asset values, which in turn led to further purchases. Losses incurred on
rebalancing trades proved particularly painful as investors second-guessed the wisdom of
buying into a bear market. For investors seeking to maintain long-term targets in the early
1970s, two years of nearly uninterrupted price deterioration produced seemingly
relentless incremental losses.
Rising equity prices provide a similar set of challenges. In a sustained bull market,
rebalancing appears to be a losing strategy, as investors constantly sell assets showing
relative price strength. Years go by without reward, other than the knowledge that the
portfolio embodies the desired risk/reward characteristics.
The alternative of not rebalancing to policy targets causes portfolio managers to
engage in a peculiar trend-following market timing strategy. Like many contrarian
pursuits, rebalancing frequently appears foolish as rum players reap short-term
rewards from going with the flow. Regardless of potentially negative reputational
consequences, serious investors maintain portfolio risk profiles through disciplined
rebalancing policies, avoiding the sometimes expedient appeal of moving with market
forces.

Burton Malkiel, in Managing Risk in an Uncertain Era, writes that "we are particularly
averse to the suggestions that a university try to move in and out of the stock market
according to its capacity to forecast market trends. Investors who wish to play this timing
game must possess an unusual degree of prescience about the course of the general
economy, corporate profits, interest rates, and indeed the entire set of international
economic, political, and social developments that affect the securities market. The
existence of such omniscience, to say the least, is hard to document."14 More succinct
advice to those who wish to time the market comes from a nineteenth century cotton
trader: "Some think [the market] will go up. Some think it will go down. I do, too.
Whatever you do will be wrong. Act at once."
Market timing explicitly moves the portfolio away from long-term policy targets,
exposing the institution to avoidable risks. Because policy asset allocation provides the
central means through which investors express return and risk preferences, serious
investors attempt to minimize deviations from policy targets. To ensure that actual
portfolios reflect desired risk and return characteristics, avoid market timing and embrace
rebalancing activity to keep asset classes at targeted levels.
SECURITY SELECTION
Market Efficiency
Investors wishing to beat the market by actively managing portfolios face daunting
obstacles. While no market prices assets precisely at fair value all of the time, most markets
price most assets with reasonable efficiency most of the time, providing few opportunities
for easy gains. Moreover, active management costs increase the hurdle for success as active
investors pay management fees, incur transactions costs, and create market impact.
Intelligent investors approach active strategies with a healthy sense of skepticism.
Sensible active managers favor markets with inefficiently priced asse and avoid those
markets with efficiently priced assets. Unfortunately, no clear measures for pricing
efficiency exist. In fact, financial economists engage in a quasi-religious debate regarding
efficiency, with one end of the spectrum represented by those who believe in the
impossibility of finding risk-adjusted excess returns and the other end of the spectrum by
those who argue that human behavior creates a range of active management
opportunities.
Degree of Opportunity
In the absence of direct measures of market efficiency, active manager behavior provides
clues about the degree of opportunity in various markets. In those markets with limited
opportunities for active management, managers deviate little from the market portfolio,
leading to market-like returns. Why do managers in efficient markets tend to "hug" the
benchmark? In a world of efficiently priced assets, consider the business consequences of
holding portfolios that differ markedly from the market portfolio. Substantial deviations
from the market portfolio's security holdings cause a manager's portfolio results to vary
dramatically from the benchmark. Underperforming managers lose clients and lose assets.
While overachievers may temporarily gain clients and gain assets (and gain public
adulation), because efficient markets present no mispricings for active managers to
exploit, good results stem from luck, not skill. Apparent success proves transitory for
active managers in efficient markets. As a result, over time, managers in efficient markets
gravitate toward "closet indexing," structuring portfolios with only modest deviations
from the market, ensuring both mediocrity and survival.
In contrast, active managers in less efficient markets exhibit greater variability in
returns. In fact, many private markets lack benchmarks for managers to "hug,"
eliminating the problem of closet indexing. Inefficiencies in pricing allow managers with
great skill to achieve great success, while unskilled managers post commensurately poor
results. Hard work and intelligence reap rich rewards in an environment where superior
information and deal flow provide an edge.
Manager behavior causes the magnitude of active management opportunity to relate
to the distribution of actively managed returns in a particular asset class. Any measure of
dispersion provides some sense of the degree of active management opportunity. Table
4.4 shows the spread between the first and third quartiles of returns for actively managed
portfolios, illustrating the extent to which more efficiently priced assets provide less
opportunity for active managers and less efficiently priced assets provide more
opportunity.

Sources: Data for marketable securities are from Russell/Mellon. The absolute return, real estate, leveraged buyout,
and venture capital data are from Cambridge Associates. Real estate, leveraged buyout, and venture capital data
represent returns on funds formed between 1995 and 1999, excluding more recent funds so that immature
investments will not bias results downward.
High quality fixed income securities, arguably the most efficiently priced asset in the
world, trade in markets dominated by savvy financial institutions. Since nobody (possibly
excepting the Federal Reserve) knows where interest rates will be, few managers employ
interest rate anticipation strategies. Without potentially powerful differentiating bets on
interest rates, institutional portfolios tend to exhibit market-like interest rate sensitivity,
or duration. As a result, managers generally limit themselves to modest security selection
decisions, causing returns for most active managers to mimic benchmark results. The
spread between first and third quartile results for active fixed income managers measures
an astonishingly small 0.5 percent per annum for the decade ending June 30, 2005.
Large capitalization equities represent the next rung of the efficiency ladder, with a
range of 1.9 percent between top and bottom quartiles. Stocks provide more difficult
pricing challenges than bonds. Instead of discounting relatively certain fixed income cash
flows, valuation of equities involves discounting more-difficult-to-project corporate
earnings. The greater volatility in equity markets contributes to the wider active manager
spread. Less efficiently priced foreign developed equities exhibit a first-to-third-quartile
range of 4.0 percent per annum, while small-capitalization stocks in the United States
show a range of 4.8 percent per annum over the decade. The progression of degree of
opportunity across types of marketable securities makes intuitive sense.
The radical break comes when moving from liquid public to illiquid private
opportunities. Absolute return, real estate, leveraged buyouts, and venture capital exhibit
dramatically broader dispersions of returns. For the ten-year period, absolute return
shows a range of 7.1 percent between first and third quartiles, while real estate and
leveraged buyouts exhibit even more extreme 9.2 percent and 13.7 percent per annum
spreads. Venture capital captures the dispersion prize with a stunning 43.2 percent first-
to-third quartile range.
Selecting top quartile managers in private markets leads to much greater reward than
in public markets. In the extreme case, choosing a first quartile fixed income manager
adds a meager 0.3 percent per annum relative to the median result. In contrast, the first
quartile venture capitalist surpasses the median by 30.1 percent per annum, providing a
much greater contribution to portfolio results. Ironically, identifying superior managers
in the relatively inefficiently priced private markets proves less challenging than
identifying skillful players in the efficiently priced marketable securities markets.
Active Manager Returns
Regardless of the scope of active management opportunities, investors face serious
headwinds in the race to beat the market. In the two most significant institutional asset
classes, domestic fixed income and domestic equity, fee-adjusted median manager returns
fall somewhere in the neighborhood of benchmark results. As shown in Table 4.5, in the
extremely efficiently priced U.S. bond market, the median fixed income manager loses 0.2
percent per year net of fees relative to the benchmark, while a first quartile manager ekes
out a gain of only 0.1 percent per annum. Active fixed income management fails
miserably. Before managing bonds actively, investors should ponder Warren Buffett's
famous dictum: "Remember, if you are at a poker table and can't identify the patsy, you
are the patsy."

points. Benchmarks: Lehman Brothers U.S. Government Credit Index for U.S. Fixed Income, S&P 500 Index for
U.S. Equity, and S&P 600 Index for U.S. Small Cap Equity.
Domestic equity markets produce slightly more hopeful results. With fee adjustments,
the median active manager exceeds the benchmark by 0.5 percent per year. A first quartile
manager adds real value, however, exceeding the benchmark by 1.4 percent per annum net
of fees. The median small-capitalization manager beats the market by a scant 0.2 percent
per annum. In contrast, a first quartile manager adds 2.3 percent per annum, reflecting
the greater investment opportunity in less efficiently priced securities.
In the case of domestic marketable securities, the proximity of median returns and
benchmarks tells the same story for bonds, stocks, and small-cap stocks. Avoid active
management, or undertake active strategies with great caution and realistic expectations.
Consider the markets in which the various securities trade. Domestic fixed income
operates in a market dominated by institutions. The returns contained in the active
manager universe represent the results of sophisticated investors trading against
sophisticated investors. Traders gain an advantage with extraordinary difficulty. As a
result, active managers post results in a narrow range, with median managers losing
relative to the benchmark and top quartile managers posting exceedingly modest
incremental returns. The highly efficient, highly competitive fixed income market stands
at one end of the continuum.
Domestic equities trade in a brutally competitive environment, but with a greater
degree of opportunity. As might be expected in the negative sum game of active
management, the median domestic equity manager produces market-like returns. That
said, top quartile managers of both large-capitalization and small-capitalization stocks
appear to add value net of fees, with less efficiently priced small-cap securities offering the
greater opportunity.
Greater inefficiency in the market environment may not lead to greater average success.
Private markets provide a case in point. Median results for venture capital and leveraged
buyouts dramatically trail those for marketable equities, despite the higher risk and
greater illiquidity of private investing. Over the decade ending June 30, 2005, deficits
relative to the S&P 500 amounted to 11.3 percent annually for venture capital, and 1.9
percent annually for leveraged buyouts, numbers that would be higher after risk
adjustment. In order to justify including private equity in the portfolio, managers must
select top quartile managers. Anything less fails to compensate for the time, effort, and
risk entailed in the pursuit of nonmarketable investments.
Survivorship Bias
Although comparisons of active management returns to benchmark results already paint
a bleak picture, managers hoping to beat the market face a challenge even greater than
suggested by a first reading of the data. Survivorship bias causes active managers as a
group to appear more successful than would be indicated by a true picture of reality, since
current data on manager returns contain only the results of the strong (survivors), having
purged the returns of the weak (failures).
Errors of underinclusion and overinclusion bias manager performance data, limiting
the usefulness of consultant reports in understanding active management results.
Underinclusion occurs when managers disappear without a trace, while overinclusion
occurs when new entrants contribute historical results to the database.
Compilations of return data generally include only results of managers active at the
time of the study. Discontinued products and discredited managers disappear, coloring
the return data with an optimistic tint. Were the generally poor results of nonsurvivors
included in the database, the challenge of beating the market would appear even more
daunting.
Even if the data gatherer undertakes to include results of failed managers, the figures
provide reasonable guidance only when considering returns on a year-by-year basis. The
shortest time frame produces the highest quality data, because the number of dropouts
tends to be smaller for the shorter time periods. More serious problems arise when
examining results spanning several years, since more managers disappear during any given
multiple-year period. Because managers tend appear after pos
poor relative
results, multiple-year comparisons suffer from return inflation driven by the superior
results of survivors.
Errors of overinclusion arise when data gatherers add new firms to the database and
incorporate the new additions' historical records. Since the new entrants necessarily
produced superior results to attract the attention of the institutional investment
community, the addition of the new entrants' historical track record (a.k.a. backfill bias)
provides an artificial boost to reported active management returns.
An examination of investment return data produced by the Russell Investment Group
illustrates in high relief the impact of survivorship bias on reported returns. Russell, a
highly regarded consulting firm, compiles and publishes one of the most widely used
investment return databases.
Russell's database suffers significant survivorship bias. Consider the U.S. equity
median manager returns as recorded in Table 4.6. In 1996, according to Russell, the
median U.S. equity manager produced a return of 22.4 percent based on reports from a
sample size of 307. As failing managers departed and up-and-coming managers entered,
the reported results for 1996 steadily improved. By 2005, the reported median manager
return for 1996 jumped to 23.5 percent, more than one percentage point above the
originally recorded result. Strikingly, the 2005 report on 1996 includes only 177
observations, a full 130 fewer than the 1996 report.
The Russell data suffer from overinclusion and underinclusion. Note that from 1997
to 1998, the number of managers increases by nine, indicating some degree of backfill
bias. Because Russell does not provide year-by-year information on gross additions to and
gross subtractions from the database, observers do not have the information necessary to
gauge the relative importance of entries and departures. That said, the more than 40
percent decline over ten years in the number of firms reporting 1996 results indicates that
departures of failed managers dominate the survivorship scene.
Precise assessment of the impact of survivorship bias on the Russell database proves
impossible. Poor returns of declining managers disappear. Strong returns of rising
managers appear. Yet some idea of the magnitude of survivorship bias comes from the
deviations between the originally reported returns and the later-reported, biased returns.
The deviations, outlined in Table 4.6, range from an increase in the reported median
return for 2000 of 4.3 percentage points, which transformed an originally reported
median loss of 3.1 percent into a later revised median gain of 1.2 percent, to no change for
the median return in 2005, the final year of the analysis. On average, survivorship bias
increases the reported median returns by 1.6 percent per year.

One imperfect estimate of the longer term impact of survivorship bias comes from
linking the annual median returns with and without survivorship bias. The imperfection
of the measure stems from the fact that linked median returns do not (except by
coincidence) represent the experience of any individual manager. Even if the linked
returns by chance reflected an individual manager's record, that manager would not likely
represent the median. Yet applying the same technique of linking medians both to the
data with survivorship bias and to the data without survivorship bias produces a rough-
justice estimate of the magnitude of the impact.
Fully Loaded Active Manager Hurdles
The cumulative impact of manager fees, survivorship bias, and backfill bias completely
transforms the active management picture. The results, contained in Table 4.7,
disappoint advocates of market-beating strategies. Even in the benchmark-hugging world
of fixed income, survivorship bias subtracts an estimated 0.2 percent from already
disappointing ten-year active returns. Adding the survivorship adjustment to the post-fee
active management deficit of 0.2 percent produces a median active shortfall of 0.4 percent

relative to the benchmark return. The market poses a tough test for active
After accounting for survivorship bias, the domestic equity net-of-fee active
management advantage of 0.5 percent morphs into a deficit of 1.2 percent per annum,
changing an optimistic story into a pessimistic tale. Simple and cheap benchmark
matching strategies crush most stock market mavens.
Survivorship bias in distributions of active manager returns fundamentally alters
investor attitudes toward active management. Data indicating that the majority of
managers beat the index encourage investors to play the active management game, while
numbers showing a preponderance of managers failing to match index returns discourage
active management. The positive bias introduced by survivor-ship bias no doubt leads to
excessive confidence in active management strategies.

Consider the numbers that institutional investors use to evaluate active managers.
Shown in Table 4.8, the pre-fee, survivorship-bias-inflated numbers encourage would-be
market beaters. Active fixed income management appears to be a winning strategy, with
nearly three-quarters of managers besting the benchmark. Adjustments for fees and
survivorship bias flip the odds and reduce the chance of winning to less than one-fifth.
The naïve comparison shows 80 percent of domestic equity managers beating the market.
Adjustments for fees and survivorship reduce the chance of winning to less than one
quarter. In the aggregate, fee-collecting asset managers win at the expense of fee-paying
institutional investors.
A cynic might argue that the money management industry benefits from inflating
returns in databases used to assess active managers. Both the active managers and the
consultants that compile data on active management want to encourage clients to engage
active managers. Painting an unrealistically rosy picture of past active management
successes no doubt motivates many investors to pursue the all-too-often-false promise of
market-beating returns.
A further note regarding the efficacy of active management relates to the dollar value
added by purported market-beating strategies. Simple return numbers tend to overstate
value added since early strong results, necessary to attract institutional interest, generally
apply to relatively small amounts of money. As size is the enemy of performance, more
established managers with greater funds under management tend to produce less eye-
catching results. Because investment management return compilations weight each
manager equally, the new managers (presumably with smaller portfolios) exert
disproportionate influence in the manager rankings. A dollar-weighted evaluation of
active management would no doubt provide even less encouragement to those hoping to
employ market-beating strategies.

In an ironic twist, survivorship bias causes active managers to appear less successful
relative to peers than reality would indicate. Consider the U.S. equity manager that
preserves capital in 2000. According to results reported in 2000, as shown in Table 4.6, a
zero percent return handily beats the -3.1 percent median result. As survivorship issues
inexorably alter the landscape, by 2005 the 2000 median return morphs into a gain of 1.2
percent. As time passed, the erstwhile median-beating zero percent return moves from the
respectable second quartile to the not-so-respectable third quartile. Survivorship bias
< 105-106/433
darkens the relative performance picture.
Active portfolio managers face high hurdles, which require that investors approach
purported market-beating strategies with great skepticism. Issues of survivorship bias
cloud understanding of historical records, causing general problems in evaluating the
efficacy of active management strategies and specific problems in assessing individual
manager performance. After adjusting for fees and survivorship bias, investors face long
odds on winning the domestic marketable securities active management game. In the
world of marketable securities, passive management provides the obvious low-cost
alternative to high-cost active management. If investors undertake active approaches,
focusing on less efficient markets increases the chance of realizing substantial gains. In the
least efficient private markets, no passive alternative exists. Even were a passive alternative
available, market-like results would likely disappoint. In sum, sensible investors engage in
active management with reasonable caution and realistic expectations.
Liquidity
Serious managers who attempt to identify inefficiencies frequently gravitate toward
relatively illiquid markets, since rewarding investments tend to reside in dark corners, not
in the glare of floodlights. Such out-of-the-way, undiscovered opportunities receive little
attention from Wall Street, which thrives on markets that generate large trading volumes.
Market players seek liquid positions, allowing immediate disposition of yesterday's
loser and rapid acquisition of today's hot prospect. Speculators and asset gatherers pay a
premium price for liquid assets, expecting markets to accommodate reversal of a trade
with immediacy and with little or no impact on price.
Illiquidity induces appropriate, long-term behavior. Rather than relying on liquid
markets to trade out of mistakes, investors in illiquid securities enter into long-term
arrangements, purchasing part ownership in a business with which they have to live. As a
consequence, increased care,
ness, and discipline represent hallmarks of
successful investors in less liquid assets.
By avoiding the highly liquid securities favored by market players, serious active
investors focus on much more interesting investments. In embracing less liquid assets,
investors often identify opportunities to establish positions at meaningful discounts to
fair value.
Full Faith and Credit Obligations
Examples of illiquid opportunities in marketable securities abound. In the realm of full
faith and credit obligations of the U.S. government, otherwise identical bonds trade at
different prices solely because market liquidity differs. The most actively traded Treasury
bonds, so-called on-the-run issues, command a price premium, which produces yields as
much as 5 to 10 basis points below those of off-the-run bonds. Based on current issuance
patterns by the government, on-the-run offerings carry terms to maturity of two, five, ten,
and thirty years. When the Treasury auctions a new ten-year bond, market attention shifts
from the old ten-year instrument to the new. Since the premium enjoyed by on-the-run
issues relates solely to superior market liquidity, the premium price disappears once a new
issue supplants the old.
Regular opportunities exist to purchase full faith and credit instruments of the U.S.
government at spreads of 40 to 50 basis points above otherwise comparable, but more
liquid Treasury issues. Because such offerings tend to contain structural complexities,
cautious investors undertake careful due diligence before committing funds. Moreover,
opportunities tend to be relatively small, requiring portfolio managers to "fill a bathtub
with a teaspoon." Nonetheless, dogged pursuit of unusual, illiquid securities can result in
the accumulation of an attractively priced portfolio of high quality assets.
Markets occasionally offer extraordinary opportunities to investors willing to accept
illiquidity. In the aftermath of a market panic in the fall of 1998, less frequently traded
assets provided enormous returns relative to highly liquid positions. On November 12,
1998, an intermediate term off-the-run Treasury issue, the 57/s's of February 2004,
yielded 18¹/2 basis points more than the on-the-run 4¹/4's of November 2003.
Beyond the extremely high reward for accepting modest illiquidity in an off-the-run
Treasury issue, in late 1998, investors willing to invest in a private placement backed by
the full faith and credit of the United States faced incredible opportunity. The Overseas
Private Investment Corporation, an agency of the United States devoted to promoting
economic growth in developing nations, offered securities with an effective maturity date
of March 2004 that carried a spread of more than 100 points over the comparable on-the-
run Treasury issue. Receiving a full percentage point in yield over Treasuries for simply
bearing the illiquidity of a private placement raises serious questions about rationality of
107-108/433
markets.
Even in times of normalcy, investors receive unreasonably large incremental returns in
illiquid securities. For example, in early 2006, investors could consider bonds issued by
National Archives Facility Trust, acting through the National Archives and Records
Administration, an independent government agency devoted to preservation, appraisal,
and regulation of the disposition of the permanently valuable records of the United States
government. The bonds, with an effective maturity date of September 2019 and a coupon
of 8.5 percent, carried a spread of more than 45 basis points over the comparable on-the-
run Treasury issue. The National Archives issued approximately $300 million of bonds, a
small figure relative to a comparably timed ten-year U.S. Treasury issue of approximately
$22.5 billion. Yet patient investors received a reward of almost a half of a percentage point
in yield over Treasuries for simply bearing the illiquidity of a small issue of the United
States government.
Emerging Market Debt
In emerging markets, U.S. dollar-denominated debt of sovereign issuers frequently trades
at a substantial premium to non-dollar debt of the same issuer. This phenomenon
presents itself most dramatically in times of crisis, when investors place extraordinary
value on the greater liquidity of U.S. dollar-denominated instruments. To arbitrage this
discrepancy investors require only a set of currency forward contracts to eliminate the
foreign exchange risk. Arbitrageurs can buy relatively cheap non-dollar debt, sell relatively
expensive dollar debt, and eliminate currency risk with forward foreign exchange
transactions. Investors paying a premium for dollar-denominated debt create an attractive
opportunity for harder working investors.
Throughout 1998, investors found some extraordinary investments amid dislocations
caused by the collapse in Asian markets. While the successful resolution of many
investments depended on market recovery, other positions promised almost certain
rewards to investors. Samsung, a highly leveraged Korean diversified electronics
manufacturer, issued debt in a variety of currencies including U.S. dollars, Korean won,
Japanese yen, and German marks. Dollar-denominated bonds generally traded at
premium prices, reflecting superior liquidity characteristics. In the fall, pricing
discrepancies reached an extreme with Samsung 9.75 percent dollar bonds due May 2003
trading at a yield to maturity of 16 percent (approximately 1,200 basis points over U.S.
Treasuries), and Samsung 3.3 percent yen bonds due April 2003 trading at a yield of 18
percent (approximately 1,700 basis points over Japanese government bonds). Investors
could create a stream of dollar cash flows by buying the relatively cheap yen bond and
swapping all future yen flows for dollars. By using the forward currency markets to
translate the Samsung yen cash flows into dollars, investors created a synthetic dollar asset
with a yield to maturity of 21 percent. The spread between the synthetic bond yield of 21
percent and the Samsung dollar bond yield of 16 percent rewarded arbitrageurs who
purchased the relatively cheap synthetic dollar asset cash flows and sold the relatively
expensive dollar bond.VI If spreads narrow, the investor unwinds the trade with a profit; if
not, the investor collects a stream of payments until the bonds mature. By applying
modest amounts of leverage to the trade, investors could expect holding period returns in
the neighborhood of 24 percent, while without leverage the position carried an 18
percent return.
Sallie Mae Stock

differences. The Student Loan Marketing Association ("Sallie Mae"), established in 1973
to provide liquidity for entities involved in programs supporting the credit needs of
students, originally raised equity capital from institutions participating in the Federal
Government's Guaranteed Student Loan Program. In 1983, creation of a new class of
more broadly held nonvoting stock increased the company's equity base, funding a
corporate growth program designed to meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of
students. The newly issued nonvoting stock traded at a premium that generally ranged
between 15 percent and 20 percent, a spread attributed by market participants to the
illiquidity of the original shares. In an attempt to reduce the discount, Sallie Mae made
regular offers to convert the cheaper, less liquid voting stock to the more expensive, more
liquid nonvoting stock. The discount persisted despite annual conversion of between 28
percent and 41 percent of shares tendered from 1984 to 1989. Curiously, a substantial
number of shareholders who owned voting shares failed to take advantage of the
opportunity. During the final tender offer in March 1989, at the height of market
participant familiarity with the program, of the 8.7 million shares outstanding, 1.5
109-110/433 >
million shares ignored an offer of $91.875 in cash for shares trading at $83.50, exhibiting
behavior difficult to reconcile with notions of market efficiency. In 1991, Congress
authorized creation of a single class of stock for Sallie Mae, eliminating the discount and
removing a trading opportunity for arbitrageurs willing to play in less liquid markets.
Illiquidity and Information
Less information tends to be available on illiquid securities, creating an opportunity to be
rewarded for uncovering insights that are not reflected in a stock's market price. Highly
liquid large-capitalization stocks receive widespread coverage, generating enormous
amounts of publicly available information. During calendar year 2006, Exxon Mobil, the
largest stock by capitalization, was covered by twenty-two Wall Street analysts and was
mentioned 659 times in the Wall Street Journal. In contrast, Avistar Communications,
the 5,000th company by market capitalization, had no research analysts and Wall Street
Journal references totaled only three.

At first glance, Exxon Mobil, which operates a complex set of global businesses,
appears to present a great opportunity for active managers. In fact, security analysts face a
tough challenge in developing an "edge" in light of competition from other analysts, all of
whom benefit from mountains of publicly available information. With Avistar
Communications, the bottom-up stock analyst finds greater opportunity. Information
will no doubt be harder to obtain, but its value will be enhanced by its proprietary nature.
Obviously, private markets present more extreme information advantages. Wall Street
research analysts do not follow private companies. Press coverage tends to be less intense,
in part because less information becomes public through government-mandated
regulatory filings. The lack of easily obtainable information about private companies
poses a challenge and creates an opportunity. Superior information flows lie at the heart
of private investing, contributing to the results of all successful partnerships.
Liquidity's Ephemeral Nature
Investors prize liquidity because it allows trading in and out of securities. Unfortunately,
liquidity tends to evaporate when most needed. The crash of October 1987, described in
the Report of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms, provides a case in point:
"as the rate of decline accelerated on October 19, the efficiency with which the equity
market functioned deteriorated markedly. By the late afternoon of October 19, market
makers on the major stock exchanges appear to have largely abandoned serious attempts
to stem the downward movement in prices. In the futures and options markets, market
makers were not a significant factor during that time.... Price changes and trading
activity were highly erratic from late Monday afternoon through most of the day on
Tuesday, October 20, as market makers were overwhelmed by selling.... Realistically, in
the face of October's violent shifts in selling demand for equity-related securities, a
rational downward transition in stock prices was not possible. Market makers possessed
neither the resources nor the willingness to absorb the extraordinary volume of selling
demand that materialized."15 Just when investors most needed liquidity, it disappeared.
John Maynard Keynes argues in The General Theory that "[o]f the maxims of
orthodox finance none, surely, is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity, the doctrine
that it is a positive virtue on the part of investment institutions to concentrate their
resources upon the holding of "liquid" securities. It forgets that there is no such thing as
liquidity of investment for the community as a whole."16
Keynes toyed with the idea of reducing market liquidity to increase the prevalence of
long-term investing. He writes "[t]he spectacle of modern investment markets has
sometimes moved me towards the conclusion that to make the purchase of an investment
permanent and indissoluble, like marriage, except by reason of death or other grave cause,
might be a useful remedy for our contemporary evils. For this would force the investor to
direct his mind to the long-term prospects and to those only."17
Success matters, not liquidity. If private, illiquid investments succeed, liquidity follows
as investors clamor for shares of the hot initial public offering. In public markets, as once-
illiquid stocks produce strong results, liquidity increases as Wall Street recognizes
progress. In contrast, if public, liquid investments fail, illiquidity follows as investor
interest wanes. Portfolio managers should fear failure, not illiquidity.
Value Orientation
Investment success follows most reliably from pursuing value-based strategies, in which
investors acquire assets at prices below fair value, "buying dollars for fifty cents." Investors
who wish to implement value oriented programs require unusual skill, intelligence, and
energy. Without a significant edge relative to other market participants, investors face
likely failure. Moreover, value opportunities tend to be out of favor with mainstream
investors, demanding courage of conviction to initiate and maintain positions.
Tobin's "q"
John Maynard Keynes in The General Theory articulated this concept of value: "... there
is no sense in building up a new enterprise at a cost greater than that at which a similar
existing enterprise can be purchased; whilst there is an inducement to spend on a new
project what may seem an extravagant sum, if it can be floated off... at an immediate
profit."18 James Tobin and William Brainard formalized this concept as "q," the ratio of
market value to replacement cost.
In equilibrium, under a reasonable set of conditions, Tobin-Brainard "q" equals one as
the market value of assets equals replacement cost. If market value exceeds replacement
cost, a "q" greater than one encourages entrepreneurs to create companies, offering them
for sale at an immediate profit in the public markets. If replacement cost exceeds market
value, a
of less than one leads entrepreneurs to acquire corporate assets in the public
market instead of building enterprises from the ground up. Value investors thrive in
environments where "q" measures less than one.
Margin of Safety
Renowned investor Benjamin Graham distills the central tenet of value investing into a
single concept-margin of safety-the cushion in value created by owning shares of a
company with "expected earning power considerably above the going rate for bonds."
Graham notes: "The margin-of-safety idea becomes [most] evident when we apply it to
the field of undervalued or bargain securities. We have here, by definition, a favorable
difference between price on the one hand and indicated or appraised value on the other.
That difference is the safety margin. It is available for absorbing the effect of
miscalculations or worse than average luck. The buyer of bargain issues plates particular
emphasis on the ability of the investment to withstand adverse developments. For in most
such cases he has no real enthusiasm about the company's prospects. True, if the
prospects are definitely bad the investor will prefer to avoid the security no matter how
low the price. But the field of undervalued issues is drawn from the many concerns-
perhaps a majority of the total-for which the future appears neither distinctly promising
nor distinctly unpromising. If these are bought on a bargain basis, even a moderate
113-114/433
decline in the earning power need not prevent the investment from showing satisfactory
results. The margin of safety will then have served its proper purpose."
"19
In today's highly efficient securities markets, few opportunities exist to acquire assets
at less than a fair price. Even with twenty-twenty hindsight, investors may not know
whether positions were purchased below intrinsic value. Adjusting for risk and assessing
the impact of subsequent external events, positive or negative, complicate evaluation of
the initial acquisition decision. Because of the difficulty of proving the efficacy of value-
investing strategies, investors accept the approach almost as an article of faith.
Perhaps the most compelling argument for value-based investment approaches rests on
contrarian principles. Markets frequently move to extremes, with high valuations for the
popular and low valuations for the out-of-favor. By looking for opportunity in neglected
securities, contrarian investors increase the likelihood of identifying profitable
investments.
Yet mindless contrarian investing poses dangers to portfolios. Sometimes popular
companies deserve premium valuations. Sometimes out-of-favor companies deserve
discounted valuations. Identifying out-of-favor assets serves as a starting point for serious
investors, leading to further analysis. Only if careful analysis confirms expectations of
superior future performance should investors purchase securities.
Purchasing stocks with low price-to-earnings ratios or price-to-book ratios represents a
naïve strategy. Simply selecting the cheapest stocks, measured relative to current earnings
or book value, neglects important factors such as the quality of a business's management
and future earnings prospects.
Historically, naïve value strategies have delivered superior rates of return, while
exposing investors to relatively high levels of fundamental risk.20 Jeremy Grantham of
Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo warns of the "sixty year flood" that may wipe out years of
gains garnered by simply purchasing the cheapest stocks. True value can be acquired by
purchasing assets at prices below fair value, a forward-looking concept that considers
anticipated cash flows with adjustment for the level of risk.
Value investors need not limit choices to low growth or distressed companies. Even
high growth industries contain companies with appealing valuations. One technology
stock manager, Sy Goldblatt of S Squared, when attending industry conferences, avoids
the rooms crowded with analysts pursuing the "flavor of the month." Instead, operating
out of the mainstream, he meets with companies that cannot attract an audience. While
many find the concepts of value and technology strange bedfellows, combining the two
creates a powerful combination. Value investors seek to purchase companies at a discount
to fair value, not to purchase low growth or distressed assets per se.
Benjamin Graham recognized that careful investors might identify value in unusual
precincts. He writes: "... the growth-stock approach may supply as dependable a margin
of safety as is found in the ordinary investment-provided the calculation of the future is
conservatively made, and provided it shows a satisfactory margin in relation to the price
paid. The danger in a growth-stock program lies precisely here. For such favored issues the
market has a tendency to set prices that will not be adequately protected by a conservative
projection of future earnings. The margin of safety is always dependent on the price paid.
It will be large at one price, small at some higher price, nonexistent at some still higher
price. If, as we suggest, the average market level of most growth stocks is too high to
provide an adequate margin of safety for the buyer, then a simple technique of diversified
buying in this field may not work out satisfactorily. A special degree of foresight and
judgment will be needed, in order that wise individual selections may overcome the
hazards inherent in the customary market level of such issues as a whole. "21 While
Graham recognizes the occasional opportunity to identify growth stocks exhibiting a
margin of safety, value oriented investors choosing among out-of-favor securities face a
richer set of attractive portfolio alternatives.
Contrarian Investing
Superb opportunities to purchase assets at prices significantly below fair value tend to be
hidden in deeply out-of-favor market segments. At market bottoms, the broad consensus
so loathes certain asset types that investors brave enough to make commitments find their
sanity and sense of responsibility questioned. In fact, Keynes writes of the contrarian
investor that "... it is in the essence of his behavior that he should be eccentric,
unconventional, and rash in the eyes of average opinion."22 Managers searching among
unloved opportunities face greater chances of success, along with almost certain tirades of
criticism.
The real estate market in the early 1990s provided obvious opportunities to acquire
dollars at a discount. In January 1994, Yale participated in the purchase of a real estate
115-116 / 423
asset with a lease that promised a rate of return of 14.8 percent. Over the term of the lease
the return would be fully realized in cash, paying back the entire investment along with a
profit and leaving a valuable asset in the partnership's possession. Even without ascribing
any residual value to the property, the real estate return of nearly 15 percent exceeded, by a
dramatic margin, comparable returns on U.S. Treasury Notes of approximately 5.75
percent. Based on the above facts, the transaction may or may not have represented good
value. Perhaps the risk of nonperformance by the tenant justified the large spread between
the lease payments and the riskless Treasury rate. In reality, the responsibility of the U.S.
government for lease payments rendered the quality of the rental stream equivalent to the
U.S. Treasury Note. Rarely do investors face clearer opportunities to buy dollars at a
discount. (Ironically, the opportunity to purchase a risk-free stream of cash flows at a
bargain price came from an agency of the U.S. Government, the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC). While the RTC generally did an effective job of disposing of assets,
attractive deals occasionally surfaced.)
The opportunity to purchase real estate assets at bargain basement prices had its seeds
in the excesses of the late 1980s. Real estate was an institutional favorite, topping the list
of attractive categories in asset allocation studies. Investors characterized regional malls as
"irreplaceable assets" with "monopoly positions," purchasing them at cash yields below 5
percent. Downtown office buildings were treated with similar reverence.
In the early 1990s the story changed dramatically. The overbuilding, over-leveraging
and overpaying of the previous decade became apparent as real estate prices went into free
fall. Regional malls, in reverse evolution, became dinosaurs, threatened by competition
from "power centers" and other new retailing concepts. Central business district office
buildings, too, were headed for extinction, as working at home was about to replace
commuting to the city.
Value-oriented investors recognized that circumstances were not as good as they
seemed in the late 1980s and were not as bad as they appeared in the early 1990s. By
simply looking at the relationship between market value and replacement cost, an investor
would be a late 1980s seller and an early 1990s buyer. Buying low and selling high beats
the alternative.
Performance Chasing Behavior
Far from exhibiting the courage required to take contrarian stands, most investors follow
the crowd down the path to comfortable mediocrity. Investor cash flows into and out of
actively managed funds provide a case in point. Ideally, serious investors would provide
funds to managers after a period of understandable underperformance and before a
period of expected outperformance. In fact, investors consistently do the opposite.
Stunning evidence, compiled by Russel Kinnel, Morningstar's Director of Fund
Research, shows remarkably consistent dismal decision making by mutual fund investors.
The Morningstar study, summarized in Table 4.10, compares mutual fund industry
returns that appear in offering documents and advertisements (time-weighted returns)
with mutual fund investor returns that consider cash inflows and outflows (dollar-
weighted returns). The analysis looked at ten years of results, covered all domestic equity
funds and divided them into seventeen categories. In each instance actual experience fell
short of reported results. In other words, investors put money into funds after good
performance (and before bad performance) and took money out of funds after bad
performance (and before good performance).
Kinnel notes that "volatility adds to the problem." Technology funds show a stunning
13.4 percent per annum gap between reported results and actual experience. Sector funds
specializing in communications and health care along with small, mid, and large growth
stock funds round out the list of failure-prone investment vehicles.

While all fund groups show poor investor decision making, less volatile funds produce
less gruesome results. The conservative allocation group boasts the best record, posting
the smallest, but still disappointing gap of 0.3 percent per annum. Other low volatility
offerings in which investors behave relatively well include large value, mid blend, and
moderate allocation.
The Morningstar study indicates that individual investors exhibit return-damaging
performance-chasing behavior with remarkable consistency. Adding the effects of
persistently perverse cash flows to the costs of active management leaves little room for
individual investor success.
Unfortunately, no comparable comprehensive data exist on institutional flows to
active managers. That said, available evidence indicates that institutions suffer from
precisely the same performance-chasing problem as do individuals. Consider the case of
Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo (GMO), an extraordinary Boston-based institutional
money manager. Despite boasting one of the best long-term records in the funds
management business, when the firm hit a rough patch clients deserted in droves.
GMO's rational, valuation-oriented systematic style failed to keep pace with the late
1990s' manic markets. Investors panicked. Between 1998 and 1999 GMO's asset base
declined from $30 billion to $20 billion even as stock markets raced ahead.23 Departing
investors lost thrice: once, by selling GMO at a low point; once, by redeploying assets to
momentum-driven managers destined to fail; and once, by failing to participate in
GMO's recovery. In a stunning indictment of active management, investors intelligent
enough to choose GMO in the first place exhibited the stupidity to abandon the firm's
disciplined approach at the point of maximum opportunity.
Consider the specific story of GMO's quantitatively driven International Intrinsic
Value Strategy. From inception in early 1987 to the end of 2006, the fund produced
returns of 11.1 percent per annum, generating a significant excess return relative to the
EAFE index result of 7.0 percent per annum. Long-term investors in International
Intrinsic Value fared extremely well.
Yet, in the aggregate, investor behavior managed to turn success into failure. Superb
returns in the early 1990s attracted investor interest, as shown in Table 4.11. Average
annual excess returns of 8.7 percent from 1990 to 1993 boosted assets in the strategy from
$378 million to $2.6 billion! As long as trailing three-year performance showed market-
beating returns, inflows continued, increasing assets under management to a peak of $2.8
billion at the end of 1996. Supposedly rational institutions chased GMO's performance.
In 1997, after the trailing three-year performance numbers turned negative, the exodus
began. Client withdrawals took assets in International Intrinsic Value from the 1996 peak
of $2.8 billion to the 2002 low point of $578 million. GMO's poor relative returns from
1994 to 1999 caused fickle clients to abandon a sensible active strategy.
Of course, exiting clients failed to benefit from GMO's dramatic recovery. As
rationality returned to markets after the early 2000 collapse of the Internet bubble, GMO
posted average excess returns of 9.5 percent per annum in the ensuing five years. Buying
high and selling low, as practiced by so many of GMO's clients, produced permanent
damage to portfolios.

Over the period from 1993 to 2003, GMO's International Intrinsic Value Strategy
beat the market by 2.8 percent per year. Client cash flows turned GMO's stellar results on
their head. On a dollar-weighted basis, clients underperformed by 2.0 percent per year.
Poorly considered commitments to and withdrawals from GMO's International Intrinsic
Value Strategy transformed a winning investment vehicle into a losing investment
alternative.
In the closed world of marketable security investing, simple logic dictates that a
majority of assets fail to beat the market, as the impact of management fees and
transaction costs guarantee poor results for most participants. Widespread active
management failure makes the unusual success all the more valuable. When foolish clients
of high quality managers destroy value by responding perversely to past performance, the
already tough case for active management becomes tougher still.
Value investing provides a sturdy foundation for building an investment portfolio, as
the acquisition of assets below fair value provides a margin of safety. In many instances,
value investing proves fundamentally uncomfortable, as the most attractive opportunities
lurk in unattractive or even frightening areas. As a result, many investors abandon sensible
strategies to pursue the fashion du jour. If pursued in a steadfast manner, value strategies
provide a measure of stability to investment programs, reducing dependence on the
vicissitudes of the market and serving to mitigate risks faced by portfolio managers.
CONCLUSION
Investment philosophy defines an investor's approach to generating portfolio returns,
describing in the most fundamental fashion the tenets that permeate the investment
process. Market returns stem from three sources-asset allocation, market timing, and
security selection-with each source of return providing a tool for investors to use to
satisfy institutional goals. Sensible investors employ the available tools in a manner
consistent with a well defined, carefully articulated investment philosophy.
Investor behavior causes policy asset allocation to dominate portfolio returns, since
institutions tend to hold stable commitments to broadly diversified portfolios of
marketable securities. Creating a diversified portfolio with a range of equity-oriented asset
classes that respond to drivers of returns in fundamentally different fashion provides
important underpinning to the investment process.
Market timing causes investors to hold portfolios that differ from policy targets,
jeopardizing a fund's ability to meet long-term objectives. Often driven by fear or greed,
market timing tends to detract from portfolio performance. Many institutions practice an
implicit form of market timing by failing to maintain allocations at long-term policy
targets. Risk control requires regular rebalancing, ensuring that portfolios reflect
institutional preferences.
Active security selection plays a prominent role in nearly all institutional investment
programs despite the poor relative results posted by the overwhelming majority of
investors. Fund managers increase their probability of success by focusing on inefficient
markets that present the greatest range of opportunities. Accepting illiquidity pays
outsized dividends to the patient, long-term investor, while approaching markets with a
value orientation provides a margin of safety. Even if investors execute active management
programs with intelligence and care, efficiency in pricing assets poses a significant
challenge to identifying and implementing market-beating strategies. In the all-too-
frequent situation where investors chase strong returns and abandon weak performance,
the odds of beating the market lengthen dramatically. Reasonable market efficiency and
unreasonable investor behavior combine to make security selection a tough game.
I. Call risk represents the risk that an issuer will redeem bonds at a fixed price prior to maturity. Bondholders
generally suffer when issuers call bonds, since calls usually occur in an environment in which interest rates have
declined.
II. Survivorship bias occurs when data exclude markets (or investment funds or individual securities) that
disappear. Since lower returning, higher-risk markets (or investment funds or individual securities) tend to fail at
a higher rate than their higher-returning, lower-risk counterparts, the sample of survivors describes an
environment that overstates the real world return and understates the real world risk.

Asset Allocation
The process of asset allocation illustrates the importance of combining art and science in
investment decision making, as neither informed judgment nor quantitative analysis alone
produces consistently successful results. At one extreme, seat of the pants decisions lack rigor,
omitting some information and either underemphasizing or overemphasizing the information
that remains. At the other extreme, mechanistic application of quantitative tools produces
naïve, sometimes dangerous, conclusions. Marrying the art of seasoned judgment with the
science of numeric analysis creates a powerful approach to allocating portfolio assets.
Defining and selecting asset classes constitute initial steps in producing a portfolio. Many
investors simply allocate among the asset classes popular at the time in proportions similar to
those of other investors, creating uncontroversial portfolios that may or may not address
institutional needs. By relying on the decisions of others to drive portfolio choices, investors fail
to take responsibility for the most fundamental fiduciary responsibility-designing a portfolio
to meet institution-specific goals.
Asset Classes and Fashion
The asset classes from which investors construct portfolios change over time. Snapshots of
Yale's portfolio throughout the past 150 years provide an impression of the evolution of
portfolio structure. Real estate constituted nearly half of the 1850 portfolio, with "bonds and
notes mostly secured by mortgages" and stocks making up the remainder. At the turn of the
twentieth century, dominant asset categories included mortgage bonds, railroad bonds, and
real estate, with relatively small allocations to "stocks in sundry corporations" and "corporation
bonds other than railroad." In the 1950s, the university held domestic bonds, domestic
common stocks, preferred stocks, and real estate. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Yale's
well-diversified portfolio included domestic bonds, domestic common stocks, foreign common
stocks, absolute return, real assets, and private equity.
Just as sartorial styles change, investment fashions cbb and flow. Railroad bonds earned
special consideration in asset allocation discussions in the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries because of the dominant role railroads played in the developing U.S. economy.
Investors willingly lent money for hundred-year terms to ostensibly secure rail companies,
knowing that even if a particular concern failed, valuable rail-bed right of way provided
unimpeachable security.
Imagine the surprise of an 1890s-vintage portfolio manager upon learning the fate of the
Lehigh Valley Railroad 41/2's duc 1989. Offered at 1021/2 in January 1891 by the distinguished
syndicate of Drexel, J.P. Morgan, and Brown Brothers, the bonds attracted little notice for the
next four decades as required payments arrived in full and on time. Widespread economic
distress in the 1930s hurt the Lehigh Valley Railroad, leading to relief in the form of the 1938
Debt Adjustment Plan. Initial concessions failed to put the rail line on sound financial footing,
leading to further negotiations that resulted in the 1949 Debt Adjustment Plan. Ultimately,
restructuring proved insufficient to solve the Lehigh Valley's woes, culminating in failure to
meet the October 1, 1970 interest payment. Bondholders, beneficiaries of a first lien on 14.4
miles of track (7.9 miles from Hazle Creek Junction to Hazleton, Pennsylvania and 6.5 miles
from Ashmore to Highland Junction, Pennsylvania) received little comfort from the security
interest, seeing the obligations trade as low as 5 percent of face value in 1972. Although not all
railway debt suffered the fate of the Lehigh Valley bonds, railroad obligations generally failed to
meet expectations.!
Railroad bonds no longer constitute a separate institutional asset class, since the rail industry
proved less enduringly robust than investors of the 1890s believed. With a heavy concentration
in railway debt, late nineteenth century investors allocated relatively little to domestic common
stocks, missing an opportunity to create portfolios with vastly superior return potential.
Twenty-twenty hindsight provides obvious conclusions regarding what would have produced
profits in the past. The basic challenge for investors lies in fashioning portfolios positioned to
succeed in the environment to come.
Investors begin by selecting asset classes and combining them in a way that promises to meet
fundamental investment goals. Institutional portfolios require assets likely to generate equity-
like returns, such as domestic and foreign cquitiès, absolute return strategies, real assets, and
private equities. To mitigate asset-class-specific risks, investors diversify aggressively, holding
assets in proportions that allow the asset class to matter, but not matter too much. By
understanding and articulating the role played by each asset class, investors create a strong
foundation for an institutional investment program.
Asset Class Definition
Purity of asset class composition represents a rarely achieved ideal. Carried to an extreme, the
search for purity results in dozens of asset classes, creating an unmanageable multiplicity of
alternatives. While market participants disagree on the appropriate number of asset classes, the
number should be small enough so that portfolio commitments make a difference, yet large
enough so that portfolio commitments do not make too much of a difference. Committing less
than 5 percent of 10 percent of a fund to a particular type of investment makes little sense; the
small allocation holds no potential to influence overall portfolio results, Committing more
than 25 percent or 30 percent to an asset class poses the danger of overconcentration. Most!
portfolios work well with around a half a dozen asset classes.
Functional attributes play the dominant role in defining asset classes, with structural and
legal characteristics taking secondary positions. Asset class distinctions rest on broad sweeping
differences in fundamental character: debt versus equity, domestic versus foreign, inflation
sensitive versus deflation sensitive, private versus public, liquid versus illiquid. Ultimately
investors attempt to group like with like, creating relatively homogeneous groups of
investments that provide fundamental building blocks for the portfolio construction process.
Fixed income represents an interesting case. If investors want fixed income assets to provide
a hedge against financial accidents, then only high quality, long-terms, noncallable bonds satisfy
the requirement. Although from a legal and structural perspective below-investment-grade
bonds (a.k.a. junk bonds or high-yield bonds) belong to the fixed income family, they lack
important crisis-hedging attributes. Junk bonds contain equity-like risks, as payments depend
mightily on the financial health of the issuer. Even if the high-yield obligor meets contractual
obligations, holders may lose bonds through a mandatory call, as lower interest rates or
improved corporate health allow issuers to redeem bonds at a fixed price prior to maturity.
Ironically, junk bondholders may lose if corporate prospects deteriorate or if they improve! In
any case, below-investment-grade bonds provide little protection against a period of severe
financial distress, since at a time of economic disruption high-yield bondholders might suffer
from a corporate default.
Government bonds dominate portfolios designed to hedge against financial trauma,
providing high quality portfolio protection. Not all Treasury issues make the grade, however.
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities have no place in a properly defined fixed income
portfolio. Traditional fixed income assets respond to unanticipated inflation by declining in
price, as the future stream of fixed payments becomes worth less. In contrast, inflation-indexed
bonds respond to unexpected price increases by providing a higher return. When two assets
respond in opposite fashion to the same critically important variable, those assets belong in
different asset classes.
Many investors include foreign bonds in portfolios as part of a broadly defined fixed income
asset class or as a separate asset class. Neither choice makes fundamental sense. First, foreign
bonds have no role in a fixed income portfolio designed to protect against deflation or financial
trauma. Investors cannot know how foreign bonds might respond to a domestic financial
crisis, since conditions overseas may differ from the environment at home. Moreover, foreign
exchange translations influence returns in a substantial, unpredictable manner. Second, as a
separate asset class, high quality foreign bonds hold little interest. The combination of low,
nai
al
bond-like expected returns and foreign exchange exposure negates any positive attributes
associated with nondomestic fixed income. If investors pay the price (in terms of low expected
returns) by buying bonds for disaster insurance, the payoff must be clear and direct.
Careful investors define asset classes in terms of function, relating security characteristics to
the role expected from a particular group of investments. In the case of fixed income,
introduction of credit risk, call risk, and currency risk diminish disaster-hedging attributes. Yet
in reaching for return or seeking an easy way to beat the benchmark, most institutional
portfolios contain disproportionate allocations to bonds lacking the purity of U.S. Treasury
obligations. The net result leads to a portfolio that meets neither the goal of producing equity-
like returns nor the goal of protecting against market trauma.
Judgment plays a critical role in defining and shaping asset classes. Unless the statistical
analysis employed in the asset allocation process rests on reasonable asset class definitions, the
resulting portfolio stands little chance of meeting institutional needs.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
Establishing policy asset allocation targets requires a combination of quantitative and
qualitative inputs. Financial markets invite quantification. Return, risk, and correlation lend
themselves to numerical measurement. Statistical methods allow analysis of possible portfolio
combinations through a number of frameworks, including the capital asset pricing model
(CAPM), arbitrage pricing theory (APT), and modern portfolio theory (MPT). Quantitative
analysis provides essential underpinnings to the portfolio structuring process, forcing investors
to take a disciplined approach to portfolio construction. Systematic specification of inputs for
an asset allocation model clarifies the central issues in portfolio management.
Nobel laureates Harry Markowitz and James Tobin developed mean-variance optimization,
one of the most useful and most widely used analytical frameworks. The process identifics
efficient portfolios, which for a given level of risk have the highest possible return or for a given
level of return have the lowest possible risk. Using inputs of expected return, expected risk, and
expected correlation, the optimization process evaluates various combinations of assets,
ultimately identifying superior portfolios. Those portfolios that cannot be improved represent
the efficient frontier, a set of points from which rational investors will choose.
Identifying Efficient Portfolios
The mere phrase mean-variance optimization intimidates many investors, conjuring images of
complicated quantitative methods beyond the grasp of the intelligent lay public. In fact, the
optimization process rests on several basic concepts, accessible to even casual students of
finance.
Mean-variance optimization identifies efficient portfolios. An efficient portfolio dominates
all others producing the same return or exhibiting the same risk. other words, for a given risk
level, no other portfolio produces higher returns than the efficient portfolio. Similarly, for a
given return level, no other portfolio exhibits lower risk than the efficient portfolio. Note that
the definition of efficiency relates entirely to risk and return; mean-variance optimization fails
to consider other asset class attributes.
Practitioners generally assume that normal, or bell-curve-shaped, distributions describe
asset class returns, allowing complete specification of the distribution of returns with only a
mean and a variance. Although using normal distributions facilitates implementation of mean-
variance analysis, real-world security returns include significant nonnormal characteristics,
limiting the value of the conclusions.
Correlations specify the manner in which returns of one asset class tend to vary with
returns of other asset classes, quantifying the diversifying power of combining asset classes that
respond differently to forces that drive returns. Correlation supplies a third means through
which asset class characteristics influence portfolio construction, supplementing the return
and risk factors.
After specifying expected returns, risks, and correlations for the set of investable asset
classes, the search for efficient portfolios begins. Starting with a given risk level, the model
examines portfolio after portfolio, ultimately leading to identification of a combination of
assets that produces the highest return. The superior portfolio takes a place on the efficient
frontier. The process then continues by identifying the highest return portfolio for a range of
risk levels, with the resulting combination of superior portfolios defining the efficient frontier.
At its core, mean-variance optimization is a simple process. Employing specified capital
markets characteristics, a quantitative model uses iterative techniques to search for efficient
portfolios. When considering combinations of assets positioned on the efficient frontier,
investors choose from a superior set of portfolios.
Limitations of Mean-Variance Analysis
Unconstrained mean-variance optimization often provides solutions unrecognizable as
reasonable portfolios. Richard Michaud, in his critique of mean-variance optimization, writes
"[t]he unintuitive character of many optimized' portfolios can be traced to the fact that mean-
variance optimizers are, in a fundamental sense, estimation-error maximizers."... Mean-
variance optimization significantly overweights (underweights) those securities that have large
(small) estimated returns, negative (positive) correlations and small (large) variances. These
securities are, of course, the ones most likely to have large estimation errors." Although
Michaud's comments pertain to a portfolio of securities, his critique applies equally to a
portfolio of asset classes.
Several fundamental problems limit the usefulness of mean-variance analysis. Evidence
suggests that security returns do not correspond to a normal distribution, with markets
exhibiting more extreme events than would be consistent with a bell curve distribution.
Richard Bookstaber, author of A Demon of Our Own Design, states that a "general rule of
thumb is that every financial market experiences one or more daily price moves of four
standard deviations or more each year. And in any year, there is usually at least one market that
has a daily move that is greater than ten standard deviations."31 If extreme price changes occur
substantially more frequently than predicted by a normal distribution, then mean-variance
analysis fails to consider some extremely important information. In fact, investors care more
about extraordinary situations in the tails of the distribution, such as the 1987 stock market
crash, than about ordinary outcomes represented by the heart of the distribution.
The way in which asset classes relate to one another may not be stable. For example, market
crises often cause otherwise distinct markets to behave in a similar fashion. In October 1987,
equity markets all over the world collapsed, disappointing those portfolio managers who
expected foreign diversification to cushion a drop in domestic equity prices. Although
correlations among individual country stock markets before and after October 1987 measured
substantially less than one, the highly correlated behavior of markets in the period immediately
following the 1987 crash caused many investors to wonder what happened to the hoped-for
diversification. Most investors rely heavily on historical experience in estimating quantitative
inputs; yet continuous structural evolution reduces the predictive value of historical returns,
risks, and correlations. Quantitative modelers face the daunting task of assigning an
appropriate weight to historical data and an appropriate weight to well-considered intuitive
projections.
Mean-variance optimization defines return distributions completely in terms of expected
return and risk. The framework fails to consider other important attributes, such as liquidity
and marketability. In fact, the inclusion of less liquid assets in a mean-variance frame-work
raises material issues. Most frequently, mean-variance optimization involves analysis of annual
capital markets data, implicitly assuming annual rebalancing of portfolio allocations. That is, if
stocks have moved above target and bonds below, then on the relevant anniversary date
investors sell stocks and buy bonds in sufficient quantities to restore target allocations. Clearly,
less marketable assets, such as private equity and real estate, cannot be rebalanced in a low cost,
efficient manner. The inability to manage illiquid assets in a manner consistent with model
assumptions reduces the applicability of mean-variance analysis.
Another problem with mean-variance optimization relates to investor time horizon. In
many cases, investors care about multiple objectives that span different time horizons. For
instance, endowment managers seek intermediate-term spending stability even as they pursue
long-term purchasing power preservation. A mean-variance time period of three to five years
might serve the spending stability criterion, while a time period spanning decades might serve
the purchasing power criterion. The almost universally employed one-year time period serves
neither. The rigidity of mean-variance optimization fails to accommodate real-world concerns
of endowment investors.
In the final analysis, both the fundamental shortcomings and the basic attraction of
quantitative methods stem from reducing a rich set of asset class attributes to a neat, compact
package of precisely defined statistical characteristics. Because the process involves materially
simplifying assumptions, unconstrained asset allocation point estimates produced by mean-
variance optimization represent simply a starting point for further work.
Qualitative Judgments
The limitations of mean-variance analysis argue for inclusion of qualitative considerations in
the asset allocation process. Judgment might be incorporated by applying reasonable
constraints to particular asset class allocations. For example, an investor could express a
preference for diversification by limiting any individual asset class to no more than 30 percent
of assets. Such a constraint ensures that no single asset class dominates a portfolio. In addition,
prospective allocations to private equity could logically be limited to a modest increase over the
current allocation. Since illiquidity and lumpiness of opportunities limit prudent expansion of
private equity holdings, incremental changes make sense.
Gradualism represents a virtue in and of itself. Substantial uncertainty surrounds the asset
allocation process. Keynes's "dark forces of time and ignorance" cloud the future, causing even
the most thoughtful estimates of capital markets characteristics to prove unreliable.+ Deciding
to make radical changes based on highly uncertain data places too much weight on a shaky
foundation. Limiting asset allocation changes by constraining asset class movements represents
a sensible modification of the optimization process.
Care must be taken, however, to avoid using asset class constraints simply to fashion a
reasonable-looking portfolio. Taken to an extreme, placing too many constraints on the
optimization process causes the model to do nothing other than to reflect the investor's
original biases, resulting in the GIGO (garbage-in/garbage-out) phenomenon well known to
computer scientists.
Alternatively, investors might identify superior, yet reasonable, portfolios by choosing from
a set of portfolios that lay near (but perhaps not directly on) the efficient frontier. In fact,
unless the current portfolio sits directly on the efficient frontier, a host of alternatives promise
higher expected returns (at the same or lower risk) or lower expected risk (for the same or
higher return). Some of the superior choices likely appear more reasonable than the portfolios
that define the frontier, giving the investor a more comfortable, yet still superior, alternative.
Quantitative modeling proves particularly helpful in focusing investor attention on
potentially rewarding asset allocation changes. By analyzing the existing portfolio using mean-
variance optimization and measuring the degree to which the optimizer prefers to move in a
particular direction, investors understand the relative attractiveness of prospective portfolio
moves. Attractive asset classes strain at the constraints, while unattractive holdings may not
even reach current allocation levels. The degree to which the optimizer "likes" a particular asset
class suggests increasing or decreasing allocations, providing a starting point for qualitative
assessment of the quantitative conclusion. Using informed judgment to modify and interpret
mean-variance results improves the asset allocation process.
CAPITAL MARKET ASSUMPTIONS
Return and risk expectations constitute the heart of quantitative assessment of portfolio
alternatives. While historical experience represents a reasonable starting point, investors seeking
to create truly useful conclusions must move beyond simply plugging historical numbers into
the mean-variance optimizer.
Developing a set of quantitative inputs for portfolio optimization poses some difficult
issues. Most troubling may be the forward-looking nature of the estimates. While past patterns
provide important input for assumptions about the future, historical data must be modified to
produce a set of numbers consistent with expected market realities. Thoughtful investors strike
a balance between respect for history and concern for analytical consistency.
Historical capital markets data require adjustment. Mean-reverting behavior in security
prices implies that periods of abnormally high returns follow periods of abnormally low
returns, and vice versa. Jeremy Grantham, a prominent money manager, believes reversion to
the mean constitutes the most powerful force in financial markets.5 If prices tend to revert to
the mean, then return expectations must be adjusted to dampen expectations for recent high
fliers and boost forecasts for recent poor performers.
Period-specific data frequently suggest counterintuitive conclusions. Relatively risky asset
classes may show returns below those of obviously less risky investments. Assets that have little
in common may move together for no apparent reason. Adjusting assumptions to reflect
appropriate risk and return relationships proves critical to sensible quantitative analysis.
Structural changes in markets force analysts to weight recent data more heavily
deemphasizing numbers posted in previous, sometimes dramatically different, environments.
Introduction of new classes of securities, such as the U.S. Treasury issuance of thirty-year
bonds beginning in February 1977, may alter asset class characteristics in so fundamental a
manner as to render earlier data far less relevant in reaching conclusions regarding future asset
class behavior.
Some practitioners seem daunted by the task of fashioning precise point estimate
predictions of future asset class characteristics. Comfort comes from the realization that great
value stems from producing a set of forecasts with reasonable relative relationships among and
between the various asset classes. Capital markets assumptions with sensible relative
relationships enable identification of a set of useful portfolio alternatives. Even if point
estimates of risk and return variables fail to match the subsequent reality, insofar as inputs stem
from well-grounded interrelationships, the mean-variance optimization process produces
valuable insight into efficient portfolio alternatives.
Unfortunately, point estimates of asset class returns remain necessary for some purposes. In
evaluating the ability of various portfolio combinations to support specified spending
requirements, the precise levels of forecast returns come into play. When deciding whether a
portfolio can reasonably produce returns sufficient to satisfy a 4 percent, 4.5 percent, or 5
percent target rate of spending, fiduciaries face the difficult challenge of relying on forecasts of
future capital markets returns. Fortunately, in the case of evaluating a portfolio's ability to
support a particular level of spending, fiduciaries require reasonably accurate forecasts of long-
term returns, which prove much less daunting than fashioning forecasts of short-term returns.
In mean-variance optimization, data on expected returns provide the most powerful
determinant of results, demanding the greatest share of quantitative modelers attention.
Forecasts of variances place second in importance, while assumptions regarding correlations
prove least crucial. Fortunately, the most intuitive variables-expected returns and variances-
play a more central role in the model than the less intuitive correlations.
Marketable Security Characteristics
Past returns for domestic stocks and bonds provide a sensible starting point for developing
capital markets assumptions, based on the centrality of marketable securities in portfolio
construction and on the availability of a lengthy series of high quality data. Choosing an
appropriate time period poses interesting trade-offs. On the positive side, longer time frames
provide a more robust picture of asset class returns and interrelationships with other asset
classes. On the negative side, a trality of marketable securities in portfolio construction and on
the availability of a lengthy series of high quality data. Choosing an appropriate time period
poses interesting trade-offs. On the positive side, longer time frames provide a more robust
picture of asset class returns and interrelationships with other asset classes. On the negative
side, a long time series includes results from periods with fundamentally different structural
characteristics. For instance, Jeremy Siegel's Stocks for the Long Run begins its study of U.S.
equity and bond market returns with data from the turn of the nineteenth century. During
significant portions of Siegel's study period, the United States was an emerging market, the
Federal Reserve System did not exist, and long-term government bonds were not available.
What relevance do stock and bond returns from the nineteenth century have to expectations
for stock and bond returns today?

Recognizing the arbitrary nature of choosing any particular subset of data to use as a
foundation for estimating future returns, one sensible starting point involves the landmark
Ibbotson-Sinquefield study, first published in 1976.7 Beginning at the end of 1925, the period
contains a sufficient number of observations to provide a rich set of data, but encompasses a
short enough span to limit the impact on markets of significant structural changes.
Using historical data (such as those contained in Table 5.1) as a foundation, sensible
investors build on that base to create a coherent set of capital markets assumptions (such as
those presented in Table 5.2). Since prudently managed endowments consume only post-
inflation returns, all capital markets assumptions reflect an appropriate inflation adjustment.
Domestic Bonds
Domestic bond market returns provide a logical baseline for building a matrix of capital
markets assumptions. Over the long sweep of time, as fixed income investors found returns
croded by spells of unanticipated inflation, bonds provided mediocre real returns of 2.5
percent per annum with risk of 6.8 percent. The October 1979 Federal Reserve decision to
target monetary aggregates instead of interest rates caused bond markets to trade with greater
volatility. Placing more weight on recent experience leads to an assumed expected return of 2
percent with risk of 10 percent.
Marketable Equities
Discussion of the difference in expected returns for bonds and stocks, more succinctly
described as the risk premium, fills many volumes of finance journals. Even while recognizing
the complexities surrounding estimation of the risk premium, asset allocators must deal with
the issue explicitly or implicitly. The historical risk premium of 8.1 percent appears to be
excessive, resulting in large part from the extraordinary performance of U.S. equities over the
past twenty-five years. Moreover, the time series of equity and bond returns suggests that the
risk premium has declined through time. Combining the tendency of a high risk premium to
mean revert with the observation that the equity risk premium seems to decline secularly,
Justifies an assumption for U.S. cquity returns of 6 percent real with standard deviation of 20
percent.
Making appropriate geographic groupings of various national equity markets poses
interesting analytical questions. Approaches range from global to regional to single country. A
global equity asset class fails to recognize the critical contribution that currency movements
make to investment returns, while individual country asset classes create too many variables for
reasonable analysis. Separating domestic equities from foreign allows investors to account for
critical home country characteristics, particularly with respect to currency. A further
distinction between developed and emerging markets groups assets with respect to important
differentiating risk and return characteristics.
Developed economics tend to share similar economic and market fundamentals. In the long
run, stock markets in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom ought to generate returns
similar to those of the United States, while exposing investors to similar risk levels. Assumed
foreign developed market returns of 6 percent with risk of 20 percent match expectations for
U.S. equities,
Relative to other marketable equities, emerging market equities expose investors to
substantially greater fundamental risks, causing rational investors to expect higher rewards and
higher volatility. Expected real returns of 8 percent compensate holders of emerging market
equities for accepting high levels of risk, represented by a 25 percent standard deviation of
returns.
Alternative Asset Characteristics
Nontraditional asset classes pose interesting challenges to the financial model builder. Unlike
traditional marketable securities, alternative assets exist outside established markets. No
benchmark returns guide investors seeking to model asset characteristics. Past data, limited in
scope, generally describe active manager returns, with results sometimes inflated by
survivorship bias. Without reliable historical information upon which to base forecasts,
investors must produce estimates of expected return and risk by considering alternative asset
classes from a fundamental perspective.
Absolute Return
Absolute return investing, first identified as a distinct asset class by Yale University in 1990,
relies on active management for its very existence. Dedicated to exploiting inefficiencies in
pricing marketable securities, absolute return managers attempt to produce equity-like returns
uncorrelated to traditional marketable securities through investments in event-driven and
value-driven strategies. Event-driven strategies, including merger arbitrage and distressed
security investing, depend on the completion of a corporate finance transaction such as a
merger or corporate restructuring. Value-driven strategics employ offsetting long and short
positions to eliminate market exposure, relying on market recognition of mispricings to
generate returns. Generally, absolute return investments involve transactions with relatively
short time horizons, ranging from several months to a year or two.
From the perspective of the late 1980s, observers might have concluded that absolute return
investing produces returns in the neighborhood of 20 percent per annum. Hedge funds had
produced impressive historical records, showing high returns with low risk and with little
correlation to traditional marketable securities. Yet if investors take no systematic risk, they
deserve a money market rate of return. In an environment with a 4 percent cost of funds, 20
percent returns from a market neutral portfolio imply excess returns of 16 percent! The high
observed returns stem from survivorship bias, a case of past performance raising the profile of
successful firms and causing less successful firms to languish in obscurity. Survivorship-bias-
infected data provide little help in fashioning market forecasts.
Bottom-up evaluation of value-driven absolute return investments leads to better
understanding of future performance. In value-driven transactions, managers often take long
and short positions in marketable equities, eliminating the impact of the market and creating
two opportunities to generate excess returns. Assume a manager in the top quartile in domestic
equities generates 2.6 percent excess returns. If the manager earns the same excess return on
both sides of the portfolio, long and short, gross returns total 8.9 percent, resulting from
adding a 3.7 percent short-term rate of return to a 2.6 percent alpha for long positions and 26
percent alpha for short positions. Based on past experience, producing 2.6 percent excess
returns represents a substantial achievement, suggesting that this analysis relies on aggressive
assumptions. After paying management fees and incentive compensation, the investor nets
approximately 6.3 percent. On a bottom-up basis, justifying return expectations of 20 percent
proves difficult. In fact, the long/short investor needs to produce excess returns of more than
10 percent on both sides of the portfolio to deliver 20 percent net returns to investors.
Producing such performance over extended periods of time would literally put a manager off
the charts.
In the early years of an asset class, historical data suffer from extreme survivorship bias,
causing forward-looking assumptions to differ dramatically from past statistics. In 1997, Yale's
absolute return data, which reflected a combination of actual experience and market returns,
showed a staggering 17.6 percent return with impressively low volatility of 11.8 percent. If
credible, the absolute return numbers indicated returns nearly double those of domestic
equities with a risk level of nearly one half. Yale responded by using a conservative approach to
determine absolute return asset class characteristics, assuming expected returns of 7 percent
real with risk of 15 percent. Even with this substantial adjustment the numbers suggested that
absolute return investments would generate higher returns than domestic stocks with less risk.
As asset classes mature, the issue of survivorship bias wanes. Consultants collect current
returns from a critical mass of participants, reducing the impact of a few attention grabbing
records. With a larger base of managers, the return inflating addition of new entrants' historical
records, a.k.a. backfill bias, plays less of a role. As a result, Yale's current absolute return
assumptions correspond more closely to historical experience, with equity-like real returns of 6
percent and below-equity-like risk of 10 percent.
Private Equity
Private equity includes venture capital and leveraged buyout participations, assets that respond
to market influences in a manner similar to marketable equities. In fact, both venture and
buyout investments resemble high-risk equity assets, raising the possibility of classifying the
private assets with marketable securities.
Private managers pursuing purely financial strategies lay the weakest claim to managing a
separate asset class. In the buyout arena, simply adding leverage to a company's balance sheet
does little to distance the private investment from the public corporation. In the case of
venture investing, a provider of late stage pre-IPO equity finance owns assets nearly identical to
small-capitalization, publicly traded equity securities. Since private investments created
through financial engineering strongly resemble their marketable security counterparts, the
argument for segregating such private assets from public securities rests primarily on
differences in liquidity.
A stronger justification for treating private equity as a distinct asset class stems from value-
added management by investment principals. To the extent that venture capitalists contribute
to the process of bringing a company from an idea with no revenues to a reality with tens of
millions of dollars in revenues, value creation occurs independent of market activity. A buyout
specialist who produces meaningful operating improvements generates similarly noncorrelated
returns. Superior opportunities for value creation, combined with liquidity and structural
differences, support treatment of private equity as a distinct asset class.
Historical data provide limited guidance in fashioning forwardlooking capital markets
assumptions. Infrequent marks-to-market cause private assets to appear less volatile than the
underlying reality. Startup companies held in a venture capitalist's partnership receive only
occasional valuations, leading to relatively low levels of observed risk. Subsequent to an initial
public offering, when a company begins day-to-day trading, measured volatility increases
dramatically. Obviously, truc risk tends to decrease as companies mature, suggesting that the
observed volatility level understates risk for privately held assets. Historical data on buyout
returns suffer from the same problem of unnaturally low levels of observed historical risk. The
combination of infrequent reporting and market insensitive valuation policies serve to disguise
true risk levels.
Guidance for specifying private equity risk and return attributes comes from the expected
relationship with marketable equity investments. Illiquidity and higher risk in private assets
demand a substantial premium over domestic equity's expectations of 6 percent returns with
20 percent risk. Assuming that private equity investments generate 12 percent returns with a
risk level of 30 percent represents an appropriately conservative modification of the historical
record of 12.8 percent returns with a 23.1 percent risk level.
Real Assets
The real assets category includes real estate, oil and gas, and timber-land, which share the
common characteristics of sensitivity to inflationary forces, high and visible current cash flow,
and opportunity to exploit inefficiencies. Real assets provide attractive return prospects,
excellent portfolio diversification, and a hedge against unanticipated inflation.
Despite important similarities, the three subasset classes differ from one another, showing
only modest correlations, as supply of and demand for each depends on fundamentally
different factors. For example, recent history indicates that oil and gas investments exhibit
negative correlation to real estate and timber. Such diversification within real assets helps to
produce steady returns through a variety of economic environments.
Real estate constitutes the core of Yale's real assets portfolio with a weight of 50 percent.
Real estate markets provide dramatically cyclical returns. Looking in the rearview mirror in the
late 1980s, investors rushed into real estate lured by returns that dominated those for
traditional stocks and bonds. A few years later, after the market collapse, those same investors
saw nothing other than dismal prospects for real estate. Poor returns nearly eliminated interest
in real estate as an institutional investment asset. Reality lay somewhere between the extremes
of wild enthusiasm and deep despair.
Real estate embodies characteristics of both debt and equity. Lease payments, the
contractual responsibility of tenants, resemble fixed income obligations, while the property's
residual value contains equity-like attributes. In extreme cases, real estate investments become
nearly bond-like. For example, properties subject to long-term, triple-net leases provide cash
flows that resemble bond coupon payments. In contrast, some real estate consists almost
entirely of residual value. For example, hotel properties, with daily leases, provide nearly pure
equity characteristics. Most real estate falls in the middle of the continuum, containing
elements of debt and equity.
Oil and gas investments range from relatively conservative reserve purchases to relatively
risky wildcat drilling. The real assets class focuses on acquisitions of producing properties,
because in place cash flows assure inflation sensitivity. The riskier exploration activities belong
in the private equity arena, at least until reserves are discovered (or not).
Oil and gas reserves generate extraordinary cash flows as production depletes reservoirs,
causing investors to receive a combination of return on capital and return of capital. The
reserve cash flows exhibit extremely high correlation to published energy prices, although
variations in geography and quality produce differentials.
Timber investments round out the real assets trio. Although timber shares the characteristic
of inflation sensitivity with real estate and oil and gas, because timber plays less of a role in the
general economy, timber prices exhibit less correlation with general price levels. Financially
astute timber owners manage holdings on a sustainable basis, cutting the amount of wood
produced each year through biological growth. When managed on a sustainable basis, the
productive capacity of the forest remains intact, preserving value across generations.
Sustainable forest management does not require lockstep harvesting of a single year's
biological growth. If timber prices appear to be relatively low, the cutting program can be
curtailed, deferring current year harvests to future years. In fact, the forestland owner receives a
bonus in the form of an additional year's biological growth as the payment for patience. Pay for
patience in the timber arena contrasts with the depletion characteristic of oil and gas
investments.
Real assets returns might be expected to fall between the expected return for stocks and the
expected return for bonds, consistent with the expectation that real assets risk falls between
that for stocks and that for bonds. In fact, inefficiencies in pricing of real assets argue for higher
expected returns, suggesting parity in return expectations for real assets and for stocks and
leading to an assumption of 6 percent real returns.
As in the case of absolute return data, historical real assets volatility numbers require
modification. With marketable equity risk at 20 percent and bond risk at 10 percent, observed
real assets risk of 6.8 percent seems inconsistent with the asset class's fundamental
characteristics. Because real assets data come predominantly from infrequently conducted
appraisals, reported returns fail to capture true economic volatility. Not only does infrequent
sampling reduce opportunity to observe price fluctuations, the appraisal process tends to
perpetuate whatever biases influenced past appraisals. Expected real assets risk of 15 percent lies
between bond risk of 10 percent and stock risk of 20 percent. Developing capital markets
assumptions by evaluating fundamental asset class characteristics allows investors to create a
reasonable framework for portfolio assessment independent of cyclical market conditions.
Correlation Matrix Assumptions
The correlation matrix is the most difficult set of mean-variance optimization variables to
specify. Less intuitive than either means of variances, correlations indicate the degree to which
asset class returns tend to move with one another.
Considering the relationship between bond and stock returns in various economic scenarios
highlights the difficulties in specifying correlations. Under normal circumstances, bond returns
exhibit high positive correlation to stock returns. When interest rates fall, bond prices rise as a
result of the inverse relationship between prices and yields. When interest rates decline, stock
prices tend to rise as investors subject future earnings streams to lower discount rates. Strong
positive correlations between stocks and bonds in normal environments produce little
diversifying power.
In the case of unanticipated inflation, bonds suffer. Inflationary price increases crode
purchasing power of fixed nominal bond payments, causing investors to push bond prices
down. While inflation may have negative short-term consequences for stocks, in the long run
stocks react positively to inflation. With unexpected inflation, the long-term correlation
between stocks and bonds proves to be low, providing substantial diversification to the
portfolio.

In a deflationary environment stocks perform poorly as economic woes cause earnings to
suffer. In contrast, bonds generate handsome returns since fixed payments appear increasingly
attractive as price levels decline. During periods of deflation, low or negative correlation
between stocks and bonds provides strong diversification.
The fundamentally different behavior of stock returns and band returns in environments of
met and unmet inflationary expectations poses a conundrum to the financial modeler. Should
the expected nondiversifying correlation apply or should the unexpected diversifying
correlation apply? The fact that investors care more about the diversifying role of bonds in
unexpected (particularly deflationary) circumstances magnifies the dilemma.
Data specification techniques for quantitative models evolve over time. When Yale began
using mean-variance optimization in 1986, the university employed unadjusted historical data
for risk, return, and correlation assumptions. Calendar year 1986 returns provided a wakeup
call. When the time series of data incorporated the S&P 500 return of 18.5 percent and the
EAFE return of 69.9 percent, relative historical returns moved in favor of foreign equities.
Recognizing the perversity of assuming that what has done well will continue to do well, in
1987 the Investments Office modified expected return data to create an internally consistent set
of return assumptions. In 1988, risk levels underwent the same type of judgmental scrubbing
that had been applied to return data the year before. Finally, in 1994, the Investments Office
adjusted the correlation matrix to reflect the staff's informed judgments regarding expected
correlations. Table 5.3 shows an unadjusted set of historical data and Table 5.4 depicts Yale's
modified set of correlation assumptions. As investors accumulate experience with
implementing quantitative models, the process becomes more intuitive, increasing the richness
of the analysis and conclusions.

A reasonable set of capital markets assumptions serves as the basis for serious quantitative
portfolio analysis. Developing sensible relative relationships produces a group of efficient
portfolios, helping investors select superior asset allocation strategies. The more difficult-to-
estimate specific levels of future returns provide necessary input in assessing the capacity of
portfolios to support specified spending levels. A thoughtful set of capital markets assumptions
contributes to a rigorous disciplined framework for the analysis of fundamental investment
issues.
Misuse of Mean-Variance Optimization
Despite mean-variance optimization's potential for making a positive contribution to portfolio
structuring, dangerous conclusions result from poorly considered forecasts. Some of the most
egregious errors committed with mean-variance analysis involve inappropriate use of historical
data. Consider allocations to real estate in the late 1980s. Real estate provided extremely strong
returns during the 1980s with relatively low volatility and relatively low correlation to
traditional marketable securities. Not surprisingly, naive application of mean-variance analysis
led to recommendations of extraordinary allocations to real estate.
The spring 1988 Journal of Portfolio Management study by Paul Firstenberg, Stephen Ross,
and Randall Zisler, "Real Estate: The Whole Story" concluded that institutional allocations to
real estate should be increased dramatically from the then current average of under 4 percent of
portfolio assets. The authors based their conclusions on data showing government bonds with
returns of 7.9 percent and risk (standard deviation) of 11.5 percent, common stocks with
returns of 9.7 percent and risk of 15.4 percent, and real estate with returns of 13.9 percent and
risk of 2.6 percent. Although, for purposes of their study, the authors increased real estate risk
levels from historical levels to more reasonable levels, their mean variance results were anything
but sensible. Efficient portfolio mixes included between 0 and 40 percent in government
bonds, between 0 and 20 percent in stocks, and between 49 and 100 percent in real estate.
Fortunately, the authors tempered their enthusiasm in taking the "pragmatic perspective...
that pension funds should seek initial real estate allocations of between 15 to 20 percent."8
The mean-variance optimizer favored real estate because of past high returns, past low risk,
and past low correlation with other asset classes. The return expectation for real estate exceeded
that for stocks by 4.2 percent. Although historical real estate risk levels measured only 2.6
percent standard deviation of returns, Firstenberg used a valuation model to justify increasing
risk levels to 11.3 percent, slightly below the assumed volatility of government bonds. The
authors' favored real estate time series showed negative correlation with both domestic stocks
(-0.26) and government bonds (-0.38). When the highest returning asset class exhibits the
lowest risk and negative correlation with other asset classes, mean-variance optimizers reach the
obvious conclusion.
The fundamental flaw in the Firstenberg study stems from failure to examine critically the
real estate capital markets assumptions. Why should real estate be expected to return more than
stocks and bonds? Why should real estate have lower risk than stocks and bonds? Why should
real estate exhibit negative correlation with stocks and bonds? Real estate contains
characteristics of both debt and equity. The stream of contractual lease payments resembles
fixed income, while the residual value shows equity-like characteristics. Hence, return and risk
expectations logically flow from and fall between those for stocks and bonds. Similarities in
factors driving valuations of real estate and traditional marketable securities lead to the
conclusion that correlations might be expected to be positive, albeit less than one. Instead of
focusing only on adjusting the risk level of real estate, Firstenberg and his co-authors should
have adjusted return and correlation levels as well.
Had an investor followed the Firstenberg advice and overweighted real estate in 1988,
portfolio results would have disappointed because both stocks and bonds dramatically
outperformed real estate in subsequent years. From 1988 to 1997, real estate returned an
annualized 4.4 percent with stocks and bonds generating annual results of 18.0 percent and 8.3
percent, respectively. When relying on historical data, after a bull market run, asset classes
appear most attractive just when future prospects prove bleakest.
Investors relying on historical data in cyclical markets invite whipsaw. In the early 1990s,
after a period of disastrous real estate performance, the asset appeared less appealing as poor
results were incorporated into past returns. Investors employing the Firstenberg approach
increased real estate holdings in the late 1980s and avoided real estate investments in the early
1990s, buying high and selling low. In the deeply cyclical real estate market, historical data
suggest high allocations at market peaks (when returns have been high and risks low) and low
allocations at market troughs (when returns have been low and risks high). Past returns provide
perverse signals to backward looking investors.
TESTING THE ALLOCATION
For many investors, defining the efficient frontier represents the ultimate goal of quantitative
portfolio analysis. Choosing from the set of portfolios on the frontier ensures that, given the
underlying assumptions, no superior portfolio exists. Unfortunately, mean-variance
optimization provides little useful guidance in choosing a particular point on the efficient
frontier. Academics suggest specifying a utility function and choosing the portfolio at the
point of tangency with the efficient frontier. Such advice proves useful only in the unlikely
event that investors find it possible to articulate a utility function in which utility relates solely
to the mean and variance of expected returns.
Identifying a set of a mean-variance-efficient portfolios fails to finish the task at hand. After
defining the efficient frontier, investors must determine which combination of assets best
meets the goals articulated for the endowment fund. Successful portfolios must satisfy the two
goals of endowment management: preservation of purchasing power and provision of
substantial, sustainable support for operations. To assess the ability of a portfolio to meet these
goals, creative modelers fashion quantifiable tests.
Preserving purchasing power represents a long-term goal. Endowed institutions promise
donors that gifts to endowment will support designated purposes in perpetuity. Evaluating
success or failure in meeting the endowment preservation goal requires a long-term measure,
spanning generations. For example, Yale quantifies failure to maintain endowment value as
losing one-half of purchasing power over fifty years.
Providing stable operating budget support represents an intermediate-term goal. Because
university operations require stable sources of support, dramatic short-term declines in
endowment income prove difficult to accommodate. Yale defines spending trauma as a 10
percent reduction in real endowment distributions over five years.
The quantitative descriptions of failure to maintain purchasing power and failure to
provide spending stability necessarily vary from institution to institution. In fact, the metrics
may change over time. In the late 1980s, when Yale began using quantitative tools to assess
portfolio efficacy, the endowment provided approximately 10 percent of revenues. At that
time, Yale defined spending trauma as a 25 percent real decline over five years. As the
importance of the endowment to the budget grew, the consequences of a material decline in
endowment spending grew commensurately. In 2001, when the endowment provided
approximately one-third of revenues, the university redefined spending trauma as a 10 percent
real decline in revenues over five years.
Unfortunately, a clear, direct trade-off exists between preserving purchasing power and
supplying stable support for operations. Although obvious challenges preclude fashioning
precisely equivalent measures of failure to preserve endowment assets and failure to provide
stable operating budget support, obtaining rough equivalence between the two measures
proves helpful in evaluating trade-offs between the two goals. The challenge for fiduciaries lies
in selecting the portfolio best suited to satisfy, to the extent possible, both goals. Quantitative
performance tests facilitate portfolio choice.
Simulating the Future
Once goals have been articulated and quantified, statistical simulations provide a mechanism
for evaluating investment and spending policies. Investors begin with a spending policy,
specifying a target rate and an averaging process. The spending policy remains constant as
various investment portfolios undergo the simulation process.IV
Simulations employ the capital markets assumptions developed for the mean-variance
optimization. Returns for each asset class, based on assumed returns, risks, and correlations
and drawn from the specified distributions, determine portfolio returns for the initial period.
The spending rule dictates the amount withdrawn from endowment, leaving the residual to be
invested in the second period. After rebalancing the portfolio to long-term policy weights,
repeating the return generating process provides data on endowment value and spending level
for the subsequent year. The process continues, creating a time series of spending and
endowment values.
The simulation process described above creates one specific path, a far-from-robust test of
portfolio characteristics. To increase the information content of the test, analysts conduct
literally thousands of simulations, providing reams of data on future spending and endowment
levels. The collective results produce a vivid picture of the future, allowing calculation of
probabilities of failure to preserve assets and failure to provide stable budgetary support.
Interpreting the simulated results requires a combination of quantitative and qualitative
judgment. Some portfolios fall from consideration on the basis that they are dominated by
portfolios that have lower probabilities of failing to meet each of the goals. Other portfolios fail
because they skew too much toward satisfying one goal at the expense of the other. Once
investors eliminate clearly inferior portfolios, decision makers assess the qualitative trade-offs
between reducing risk on one measure while increasing risk on another. In the final analysis,
portfolio selection involves careful subjective assessment of trade-offs between conflicting goals.
One significant benefit of running simulations lies in the direct link between the
quantitative analysis and the goals articulated for endowment management Mean-variance
optimization, run in isolation, produces a set of efficient portfolios. The fund manager, faced
with a set of efficient combinations of assets, chooses between them with little idea which
portfolio might best address the fund's needs. How should investors choose between Figure
5.1's portfolio A with an expected return of 5.75 percent and standard deviation of 10.0
percent, and portfolio B with an expected return of 7.1 percent and standard deviation of 14.5
percent? Economists might suggest that a utility function be employed to identify the
appropriate asset allocation. Since few market participants would have any idea how to specify
such a function, this technique proves remarkably unhelpful.
In contrast, simulation data address directly the issue facing fiduciaries, describing the trade-
off between the conflicting goals of endowment management. Figure 5.2 shows the set of
choices identi through a program of simulations. In selecting either portfolio A with 28.4
percent probability of a disruptive spending drop and 29.6 percent probability of long-term
purchasing power impairment, or portfolio B with 24.9 percent probability of a disruptive
spending drop and 27.0 percent probability of purchasing power impairment, investors express
preferences on the trade-off between two goals central to an endowment's mission. Instead of
wondering about the impact on institutional goals of a mean-variance efficient portfolio with
certain expected risk and return characteristics, simulations allow investors to examine the
degree to which spending and investment policies serve articulated goals. Simulations build on
the foundation of mean-variance optimization, allowing direct assessment of goals identified by
fund fiduciaries.

Simulations liberate mean-variance analysis from another of its practical limitations: the use
of a single, frequently one-year investment period. Forward-looking simulations address the
problem by allowing the use of any desired time frame. The intermediate-term issue of
providing stable operating budget support can be analyzed in an intermediate-term context.
The long-term issue of preserving purchasing power can be evaluated in a long-term context.
By employing simulations, the mean-variance abstraction of a set of portfolios that provide the
highest expected return for a given level of risk gives way to concrete measures of the degree to
which portfolios meet investor goals.
Results of Disciplined Portfolio Management
The use of quantitative tools makes a difference. For example, Figure 5.3 shows the
improvement in Yale's portfolio from 1985 to 2005 as the university applied quantitative asset
allocation techniques to endowment management. The improvements in expected spending
stability and prospective purchasing power preservation came in spite of three increases in the
spending rate.
Some observers question the robustness of conclusions based on a set of institution-specific
capital markets assumptions. While far from dispositive, examining the results of portfolios
managed using mean-variance optimization provides some insight into the answer.
Among college and university endowments, Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford have a
particularly long history of using quantitative portfolio management tools. Although minor
variations in conclusions result from differences in data inputs and investment preferences
among the four institutions, specific portfolio recommendations tend to be supported by all
four sets of assumptions. As illustrated in Table 5.5, the independently derived sets of capital
markets assumptions produce reasonably similar results.
The largest university endowments pursue asset allocation strategies dramatically different
from those of other educational institutions. Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford exhibit
substantially greater diversification than the average endowment. Domestic equities dominate
most endowment portfolios, averaging 42 percent of assets, while the better-diversified large
institutional portfolios commit only 15 percent to domestic equities. Domestic bonds account
for 20 percent of the average endowment's portfolio in contrast to an allocation of 11 percent
by Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford. Private assets, including venture capital, leveraged
buyouts, real estate, timber, and oil and gas, which barely register among the broad group of
educational institutions and account for less than 10 percent of assets, play an important role
for the major endowments with an allocation of 40 percent. Disciplined quantitative modeling
techniques encourage investors to create well-diversified portfolios.

The largest university endowments pursue higher return strategies, causing expected returns
for the funds to exceed the average by 1.1 percent, a substantial increment relative to the
broader group's expected return of 5.5 percent. In spite of producing greater expected returns,
large institution portfolio risk levels actually fall below risk estimates for the less well-diversified
endowments. Employing rigorous quantitative portfolio analysis contributes to the
construction of diversified, high-return portfolios.
Built on the philosophical principles of equity orientation and diversification, asset allocation
decisions provide the framework that supports creation of effective investment portfolios.
Placing policy allocation targets at the center of the investment process lends a measure of
stability to funds invested in an uncertain world.
Purely statistical descriptions of various asset allocation alternatives provide little guidance
for decision makers. The widely used Markowitz mean-variance optimization process produces
a set of efficient portfolios, fully described by two parameters: expected return (mean) and
expected risk (standard deviation). Academics identify optimal portfolios by specifying an
institutional utility function that produces a point of tangency with the mean-variance
efficient frontier. Even in the unlikely event the academic approach proves helpful, decision
makers wonder how the chosen portfolio will interact with the institution's spending policy.
A number of problems implicit in most applications of mean-variance analysis limit its
usefulness in evaluating portfolios. Incorporating sensible qualitative considerations into the
asset allocation process represents a critical factor in reaching reasonable conclusions. Informed
judgment plays a significant role in selecting and defining asset classes, as well as in constructing
a coherent set of capital markets assumptions. Combining powerful quantitative tools and
sensible qualitative decisions provides a starting point for asset allocation decisions.
The use of simulations to test portfolios created through mean-variance optimization allows
assessment of the effectiveness of investment and spending policies over appropriate time
horizons. Employing the same capital markets assumptions used in mean-variance analysis, the
simulations allow examination of longer time frames, consideration of interaction between
spending and investment policies, and translation of statistical capital market and portfolio
characteristics into relevant quantitative criteria for decision makers.
Failure to achieve investment goals defines portfolio risk in the most fundamental way.
Goals, and risks following therefrom, must be described in a manner allowing investment
fiduciaries to understand trade-off's between various portfolios. By evaluating portfolios in
terms of probabilities of maintaining purchasing power and providing stable spending streams,
fiduciaries understand and choose among alternatives defined in the context of criteria directly
relevant to institutional objectives.
Portfolios generated through a combination of mean-variance optimization and forward-
looking simulation suffer from a number of limitations. The results depend on assumptions
regarding future returns, risks, and covariances. While precise levels of return estimates are
certain to be wrong, much of the power of the analysis stems from evaluating casier-to-assess
relative relationships. If the quality of the capital markets return and risk assumptions
represented the greatest hurdles, conclusions reached through quantitative analysis would be
quite robust.
More serious problems stem from instability in the risk and covariance characteristics of
asset classes. The tendency of markets for risky assets to move together in times of crisis reduces
the value of diversification, at least in the short run. Questions regarding the nature of
distributions of securities returns and the stability of relationships between asset classes pose
serious challenges to quantitative modeling of asset allocation. Nonetheless, the process of
quantifying portfolio analysis provides discipline lacking in less rigorous approaches to
portfolio construction.
A systematic, quantitative portfolio construction process lies at the heart of portfolio
management activity, providing a disciplined framework within which qualitative judgments
inform portfolio decisions. By recognizing and affirming the centrality of policy asset allocation
targets, fund managers sensibly focus on the most powerful investment management tool.
Ultimately, thoughtful asset allocation work provides the basis for building a successful
investment program.6
Asset Allocation Management
The fundamental objective of portfolio management is faithful implementation of long-term
asset allocation targets. If investors allow actual portfolio holdings to differ materially from
asset class targets, the resulting portfolio fails to reflect the risk and return preferences
determined by the asset allocation process. By holding assets in proportion to policy targets and
generating asset class returns commensurate with market levels, investors achieve investment
goals without slippage.
Only the most basic portfolios, consisting entirely of marketable securities, allow investors
to implement investment policies precisely, holding asset classes at targeted levels and using
passive investment vehicles to mirror market returns. Disciplined investors maintain targeted
levels by following a systematic program of rebalancing, using proceeds from selling assets
exhibiting relative strength to fund purchases of assets showing relative weakness. The use of
low cost, passive investment vehicles facilitates the seamless implementation of policy asset
allocation targets in marketable security portfolios. Serious pursuit of rebalancing ensures that
portfolios maintain target levels, exposing the fund to the desired risk and return
characteristics.
Unfortunately, for all except the simplest structures, when implementing an investment
program, real world complexities drive a wedge between the clearly defined ideal and the messy
reality. Investment in illiquid vehicles, pursuit of active management strategies, and use of
explicit or implicit leverage cause actual performance to differ from the theoretical returns
associated with the policy portfolio.
Less liquid asset types introduce the likelihood that actual allocations deviate from target
levels. Shortfalls or surpluses in private assets require offsetting positions in more liquid assets,
driving portfolio characteristics away from desired levels. Since by their very nature private
holdings take substantial amounts of time to buy or sell efficiently, actual portfolios usually
exhibit some functional misallocation. Dealing with the over- or underallocation resulting
from illiquid positions creates challenges for thoughtful investors.
Even when actual portfolio allocations match long-term targets, active management
techniques usually cause asset class returns to differ from index returns. If inefficiencies exist in
the pricing of individual securities, market participants might be rewarded for uncovering
attractive investment opportunities with risk-adjusted excess returns. Portfolio managers
willingly accept risks associated with active management, expecting that investment skill will
ultimately provide material rewards. But because the expected excess returns arrive in
unpredictable fashion, if at all, the actively managed asset class might suffer from periods of
material underperformance, opening a gap between a disappointing reality and the hoped-for
positive active management result.
Leverage, both implicit and explicit, poses another challenge to the faithful implementation
of policy asset allocation targets. By magnifying investment outcomes, both good and bad,
leverage fundamentally alters the risk and return characteristics of investment portfolios.
Unless fiduciaries pay close attention to investment activities, leverage exposes funds to
unanticipated outcomes. Implicit leverage, often found in derivatives positions, lurks in many
portfolios, coming to light only when investment disaster strikes. Explicit leverage, such as that
embodied in security lending programs, contains potential to alter portfolio risk characteristics
in unwelcome ways. Understanding and controlling the degree of leverage in particular policies
and strategies allows investors to fashion investment portfolios appropriate to their tolerance
for risk.
Many market participants treat risk with little sophistication. Portfolio managers spend
enormous amounts of time, energy, and resources on asset allocation projects, implement the
recommendations, and then let portfolio allocations drift with the markets. Some investors
pursue active management programs by cobbling together a variety of specialist managers,
without understanding the sector, size, or style bets created by the more-or-less random
portfolio construction process. Other participants hire managers based on strong past
performance, forgetting to evaluate the investment program, unaware of hidden leverage likely
to provide volatile performance. A thoughtful portfolio management process ensures that
funds accept only those risks that comport with the asset allocation targets and that promise
sufficient incremental rewards.
The Greek author Palladas may have had portfolio management in mind when he wrote
that "there be many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip." Asset allocation drift and active
management risk contain the potential to create outcomes measurably different from
expectations based on the policy asset allocation portfolio. Moreover, exposure to implicit and
explicit leverage moves portfolios to risk levels materially different from baseline expectations,
dramatically altering expected investment outcomes. Disciplined implementation of asset
allocation policies avoids altering the risk and return profile of an investment portfolio,
allowing investors to accept only those active management risks expected to add value.
Concern about risk represents an integral part of the portfolio management process,
requiring careful monitoring at the overall portfolio, asset class, and manager levels.
Understanding investment and implementation risks increases the chances that an investment
program will achieve its goals.
REBALANCING
Proper use of mean-variance optimization and forward looking simulations places risk
considerations at the heart of the investment management process. By evaluating the likelihood
that investment policies fail to meet articulated goals, investors confront directly the critical
financial risks facing an institution. The asset allocation targets selected through thoughtful
application of quantitative tools and informed judgment define with reasonable precision a
portfolio of assets likely to satisfy institutional needs.
After establishing asset allocation policies, risk control requires regular rebalancing to policy
targets. Movements in prices of financial assets inevitably cause asset class allocations to deviate
from target levels. For instance, a decline in stock prices and an increase in bond prices leads
stocks to be underweight and bonds to be overweight, causing the portfolio to have lower than
desired expected risk and return characteristics. To restore the portfolio to target allocations,
rebalancing investors purchase stocks and sell bonds.
Rebalancing facilitates reshaping of marketable security portfolios, providing an impetus to
examine manager allocations. Investors improve portfolio returns by giving funds to managers
expected to outperform, and withdrawing money from those with less rosy prospects. In the
absence of fundamental reasons to change manager allocations, positive results might be
expected from following the strategy of withdrawing money from managers posting strong
recent performance and supplying money to those with weak numbers. When in doubt, lean
against the wind.
Psychology of Rebalancing
Contrarian behavior lies at the heart of many successful investment strategies. Unfortunately
for investors, human nature craves the positive reinforcement that comes from running with
the crowd. The conventional attitude comes through loud and clear in the words of Cabaret's
Sally Bowles: "Everybody loves a winner, so nobody loved me. Contrarian investment
behavior requires shunning the loved and embracing the unloved. Most people prefer the
opposite.
In fact, the world of commerce (as opposed to the world of investment) generally rewards
following the trend. Feeding winners and killing losers leads to commercial successes.
Executives who hyper-charge winners produce attractive results. Managers who starve losers
conserve scarce resources. In the Darwinian world of business, success breeds success.
In the world of investments, failure sows the seeds of future success. The attractively priced,
out-of-favor strategy provides much better prospective returns than the highly valued, of-the-
moment alternative. The discount applied to unloved assets enhances expected returns, even as
the premium assigned to favored assets reduces anticipated results.
stors find mainstream positions comfortable, in part because of the feeling of
safety in numbers. The attitudes and activities of the majority create the consensus. By
definition, only a minority of investors find themselves in the uncomfortable position of
operating outside of the mainstream. Once a majority of players adopts a heretofore contrarian
position, the minority view becomes the widely held perspective. Only an unusual few
consistently take positions truly at odds with conventional wisdom.
Initiating and maintaining out-of-the-mainstream positions requires great conviction and
substantial fortitude. Friends and acquaintances describe fundamentally different investment
programs. The media push a dramatically divergent world view. Brokers urge the sale of
yesterday's losers and the purchase of today's hot prospects. Advertisements proclaim a new
paradigm. In the face of a seemingly overwhelming consensus, successful contrarian investors
turn a deaf ear to the blandishments of the multitudes.
Establishing a contrarian position constitutes only half of the battle. Failure awaits the
contrarian investor who loses nerve. Suppose an investor initially avoids the flavor of the
month. Months become quarters and quarters become years. Ultimately, the weak-kneed
contrarian capitulates, buying into the new-era reasoning. Of course, the buy-in comes just as
the mania peaks, causing the realization of pain without the offset of gain. Taking a contrarian
tack in the absence of the ability to persevere leads to poor results.
Rebalancing represents supremely rational behavior. Maintaining portfolio targets in the
face of market moves dictates sale of strong relative performers and purchase of poor relative
performers. Stated differently, disciplined rebalancers sell what's hot and buy what's not.
Under normal circumstances, rebalancing asks for modest degrees of fortitude. When markets
make extreme moves, rebalancing requires substantial amounts of courage.
Rebalancing Frequency
Investors debate the frequency with which portfolios should be rebalanced. Some follow the
calendar, transacting monthly, quarterly, or annually. Others attempt to control transactions
costs, setting broad limits and trading only when allocations exceed specified ranges. A small
number pursue continuous rebalancing, a strategy that provides greater risk control with
potentially lower costs than either the calendar or trading range approaches.
Continuous rebalancing requires daily valuation of portfolio assets. If asset class values
deviate by as much a one or two tenths of a percent from target values, managers trade
securities to achieve targeted levels. Trades tend to be small and accommodating to the market.
Since rebalancing requires sale of assets experiencing relative price strength and purchase of
assets experiencing relative price weakness, the immediacy of continuous rebalancing causes
managers to sell what others are buying and buy what others are selling, thereby providing
liquidity to the market. In contrast, rebalancing strategies not as responsive to the market
require larger and less accommodating transactions, increasing market impact and transactions
costs.
To the extent that markets exhibit excess volatility, continuous rebalancing generates excess
returns. Market activity on October 27 and 28, 1997 provides a dramatic example. On October
27, a 6.9 percent drop in stock prices accompanied a rally in the bond market. The following
day's reversal saw stocks rebound by 5.1 percent with bonds suffering from selling pressure.
Rebalancing a 60 percent equity and a 40 percent bond portfolio on those two October days
added ten basis points to returns, providing a bonus for an activity dedicated fundamentally to
risk control.
Even though rebalancing profits represent a nice bonus for investors, the fundamental
motivation for rebalancing concerns adherence to long-term policy targets. In the context of a
carefully considered policy portfolio, rebalancing maintains the desired risk level. Thoughtful
investors employ rebalancing strategies to meet policy asset allocation targets.
Rebalancing and Illiquidity
Owners of private assets face a particular challenge in rebalancing activity. At any point in time,
illiquid holdings of private equity and real assets are unlikely to match targeted levels. An
amount of assets equivalent to the aggregate illiquid portfolio shortfall (or surplus) must be
invested in (or withdrawn from) liquid securities portfolios. Appropriate candidates for
investing private asset under-allocations include shorter duration, low risk assets, since funds
may be required on short notice to make investments to bring private portfolios closer to target
levels. Cash, bonds, and absolute return investments provide reasonable temporary alternatives
for private asset underallocations.
The strategy of investing underallocations of private assets in apparently similar marketable
securities holds superficial appeal. For instance, while attempting to build a venture capital
portfolio, allocation shortfalls might be invested in a portfolio of small technology stocks.
Unfortunately, the strategy exposes investors to the risk that venture partnerships call funds
when technology stocks trade at depressed levels, causing sales to be made at an inopportune
time. In the final analysis, private assets constitute separate asset classes because they behave in a
fundamentally different fashion from marketable securities, making dependence on high short-
run correlation between private and public markets an internally inconsistent, potentially
dangerous strategy.
When private allocations exceed target levels, as might be the case when marketable
securities prices decline relative to private asset values, investors face a difficult problem.
Reducing allocations to higher risk marketable securities and relying on correlations between
marketable and private assets poses substantial risks. Yet, reducing allocations to lower risk
assets to accommodate excessive levels of private equity further increases an already elevated
portfolio risk level. Choosing the least bad alternative, investors should fund overallocations to
private assets by reducing holdings of risky marketable assets, thereby controlling overall
portfolio risk levels.
Using short duration, lower risk assets to substitute for generally higher return private assets
decreases expected portfolio return and risk levels, while the opposite result occurs when
reducing marketable security positions to accommodate a private equity overweighting
Because differences may be substantial between characteristics of target and actual portfolios,
investors must analyze thoroughly the investment and spending implications of both target
asset allocations and actual portfolio allocations.
The potential for material differences between actual and target asset allocation argues for
gradualism in altering targets for illiquid asset classes. Keeping the reality close to the goal
facilitates analysis of appropriate spending and asset management possibilities. Avoiding large
differences between actual and target allocations reduces the size of the mismatch requiring
temporary placement in an alternative investment vehicle, limiting the impact of a decision
fraught with problems.
Rebalancing helps investors achieve the risk and return profile embodied in the policy
portfolio. Institutions that follow no particular rebalancing policy engage in a peculiar form of
market timing. By allowing portfolio allocations to drift with the whims of the market,
portfolio risk and return characteristics change unpredictably, introducing more noise into an
already highly uncertain process. In fact, over long periods of time, without rebalancing.
portfolio allocations move toward the highest return asset, increasing the overall risk level of
the portfolio. Ultimately, disciplined rebalancing provides risk control, increasing the
likelihood that investors achieve investment goals.
ACTIVE MANAGEMENT
After establishing policy asset allocation targets, investors face individual asset class
management issues. In the marketable securities arena, passive investment vehicles provide near
certainty that investment results mirror market activity. To the extent that investors pursue
active strategies, actual results will likely differ from the market, causing asset class
characteristics to differ from those of the market as a whole. In the alternative asset arena, lack
of passive investment vehicles inevitably causes active results to vary, sometimes dramatically,
from baseline return expectations.
Investing in passively managed vehicles representing individual asset classes effectively
eliminates variance from market results. Index funds cost little to implement, present far fewer
agency issues than do actively managed portfolios, and promise faithful replication of market
portfolios. What explains the fact that few institutional portfolios employ passive management
exclusively? Certainly, the game of active management entices players to enter, offering the
often false hope of excess returns. Perhaps those few smart enough to recognize that passive
strategies provide a superior alternative believe themselves to be smart enough to beat the
market. In any event, deviations from benchmark returns represent an important source of
portfolio risk.
Investors embarking on active management strategies introduce portfolio biases, either
purposeful or inadvertent. Among the powerful ways in which asset classes might differ from
benchmarks are with respect to size, sector, and style. Size refers to market capitalization of
securities holdings, sector concerns the nature of corporate business activities, and style relates
to the general approach taken by an active manager (value vs. growth).
Deliberate portfolio biases create potential for significant value added. For instance, an
investor might believe that value strategies dominate growth strategies, consciously choosing
only managers with a value orientation. Others believe that small-capitalization stocks provide
superior stock picking opportunities, moving portfolios toward an explicit overweighting in
securities of smaller companies. Purposeful, thoughtful strategic bets might generate risk-
adjusted excess returns for the portfolio.
Portfolio biases come with potential costs. Hiring managers specializing in particular market
segments sometimes skews portfolio characteristics dramatically. Consequently, fiduciaries face
the possibility of meaningful underperformance as short-term costs (poor relative performance
from small stocks) overwhelm long-term opportunities (less efficient pricing of small-
capitalization securities). Strategic portfolio biases add value only if implemented in a
disciplined fashion, after thoughtful analysis, with an appropriately long investment horizon.
Some portfolio bets result from sloppy management. If portfolio construction simply
involves collecting enough domestic equity managers to fill the slots in the portfolio's roster,
the resulting asset class characteristics almost certainly contain significant inadvertent biases.
Unintended portfolio bets often come to light only after being directly implicated as a cause for
substandard performance.
Completeness Funds and Normal Portfolios
The investment management tools of normal portfolios and completeness funds allow
managers to evaluate and control portfolio biases. A normal portfolio defines the universe of
securities from which a manager selects holdings. As such, a normal portfolio represents a fair
benchmark for measuring manager performance. If the aggregate of the normal portfolios
within an asset class matches size, style, and sector distributions of that asset class, the resulting
portfolio contains no deliberate bets relative to size, style, or sector. Bets resulting from active
manager decisions still influence portfolio returns, but those bets ought to be welcomed as part
of a deliberate active management strategy.
If the aggregate of normal portfolios within an asset class fails to match important asset class
characteristics, portfolio managers introduce biases. One way to offset inadvertent biases is
through the use of completeness funds. A completeness fund simply represents the portfolio of
securities, complementary to the aggregate of an asset class's normal portfolios, that causes the
sum of the normal portfolios plus the completeness fund hatch relevant asset class
characteristics.
By offsetting gaps left by the aggregate of a fund's normal portfolios, completeness funds
cause portfolio returns to be driven by deliberate choice, not inadvertently assumed residual
risk. A danger in using completeness funds lies in the imprecision inherent in identifying
normal portfolios. Poorly defined normal portfolios lead to poorly structured completeness
funds, which may fail to fill unidentified portfolio gaps or may offset deliberate security
selection bets.
Because deviations from asset class characteristics cause performance to differ from the
market, fund managers must ensure that deliberate choice drives portfolio structure, not
sloppy construction. Normal portfolios and completeness funds assist investors with asset class
management, but precise application of these tools remains a theoretical goal, not a practical
reality.
LEVERAGE
Leverage appears in portfolios explicitly and implicitly. Explicit leverage involves the use of
borrowed funds for pursuit of investment opportunities, magnifying portfolio results, good
and bad. When investment returns exceed borrowing costs, portfolios benefit from leverage.
When investment returns match borrowing costs, no impact results. When investment returns
fail to meet borrowing costs, portfolios suffer from leverage.
Implicit leverage stems from holding positions that embody greater risk than contemplated
by the asset class within which they are categorized. Simply holding riskier-than-market equity
securities leverages the portfolio. Unless risk levels of securities within an asset class match asset
allocation risk assumptions, the portfolio either becomes leveraged from holding riskier assets
or deleveraged from holding less risky assets. For example, the common practice of holding cash
in portfolios of common stocks causes the equity portfolio to exhibit less risk than the market,
effectively deleveraging returns.
Derivatives provide a common source of implicit leverage. Suppose an S&P 500 futures
contract requires a margin deposit of 10 percent of the value of the position. If an investor
holds a futures position in the domestic equity portfolio, complementing every dollar of
futures with nine dollars of cash creates a position equivalent to holding the underlying equity
securities directly. If, however, the investor holds five dollars of futures and five dollars of cash,
the resulting implicit leverage causes the position to be five times as sensitive to market
fluctuations.
Derivatives do not create risk per se, as they can be used to reduce risk, simply replicate cash
positions, or increase risk. To continue with the S&P 500 futures example, selling futures
against a portfolio of equity securities reduces risks associated with equity market exposure.
Alternatively, using appropriate combinations of cash and futures creates a risk-neutral
replication of the underlying securities. Finally, holding futures without risk-neutralizing cash
positions increases market exposure. Responsible fiduciaries understand and control the use of
derivatives in investment activity.
Leverage magnifies portfolio outcomes, containing the potential to benefit or to harm
portfolio assets. In extreme cases, inconsistency between the risk profile of asset class
characteristics and investment activity leads to significant losses. In less extreme cases,
differences in risk profile cause portfolio attributes to vary meaningfully from targeted levels,
leading to deviations from policy goals. Sensible investors employ leverage with great care,
guarding against introducing material excess risk into portfolio characteristics.
Harvard University
Harvard University's endowment employs leverage in a variety of ways. Consider the
university's June 2005 portfolio. By establishing an unusual asset allocation target of negative 5
percent to cash, the university hopes to enhance portfolio results by generating returns in
excess of borrowing costs. Over long periods of time, Harvard's borrowing strategy promises
superior results as portfolio returns should exceed leverage costs represented by the return of
cash, the lowest-expected-return asset class. Of course, if returns fall below the cost of funds,
results of a bad year will be made worse. In the case of Harvard's negative allocation to cash,
careful disciplined analysis of portfolio considerations led to the use of leverage.
Harvard's second form of explicit leverage involves borrowing substantial amounts of funds
to establish positions exploiting mispricings between securities. At June 30, 2005, the
university's $29.4 billion investment pool supported long positions of $49.7 billion offset by
short positions of $20.3 billion. By altering fundamental asset class risk characteristics, the use
of leverage magnifics security selection bets. In contrast to the asset allocation process's direct
consideration of the consequences of the negative allocation to cash, by grossing up positions
on the balance sheet Harvard alters portfolio risk outside of the mean-variance framework.
On top of explicit balance sheet leverage, Harvard employs implicit leverage to magnify
further the impact of investment decisions. A careful reading of the footnotes to Harvard's
financial statements shows off balance sheet market exposure of more than $19 billion in long
positions and more than $28 billion in short positions. As a consequence of substantial explicit
and implicit leverage, Harvard dramatically increases risk levels, enhancing positive and
negative outcomes alike.
Sowood Capital
Harvard suffered the consequences of excessive leverage in the July 2007 collapse of Sowood
Capital. Managed by former Harvard Management Company partner Jeff Larson, Sowoo
began operations in July 2004 with fourteen employees and $700 million of Harvard's funds.
The firm's pitch book promised investors strictly market neutral, event-driven investments,
quantitative-based arbitrage and value-oriented investments.2 According to the Wall Street
Journal, Sowood "gained around 10% annually during its first three years, often through savvy
bets on debt investments," delivering on its promises to investors and growing assets to more
than $3 billion.3
In early 2007, Jeff Larson's portfolio contained a substantial bet on the relative values of
senior corporate debt and Junior corporate securities. He owned the safer senior securities and
sold short the riskier junior securities, establishing what he expected to be a profitable hedge
against adverse market conditions.
Had Sowood simply attempted to exploit the price differential between the senior and
Junior securities, the firm would have avoided the attention of the Wall Street Journal and the
New York Times. But because the price differential alone provided inadequate recompense,
Sowood levered the portfolio by "as much as six times," hoping to transform a small price
discrepancy into big returns. The leverage transferred the fate for the firm from Sowood's
principals to its banks.
In June, the first cracks started to appear, as the fund lost 5 percent for the month. To take
advantage of the now-more-attractive opportunity, according to the Wall Street Journal,
Sowood doubled the portfolio's leverage to twelve times.
In July, as debt markets grew increasingly unsettled, Sowood's trades should have paid off
with safer positions (that Sowood owned) maintaining value and riskier positions (that
Sowood sold short) losing value. Instead, perverse market forces caused the safer positions that
Sowood owned to lose value without an offsetting gain from the positions that Sowood sold
short.
In a July 30 letter to investors, Jeff Larson described the force that finished his fund:
... given the extreme market volatility, our counterparties began to severely mark down
the value of the collateral that had been posted by the funds. In addition, liquidity
became extremely limited for the credit portion of our portfolio making it difficult to
cxit positions. We, therefore, reached the conclusion over the weekend that, in the
interest of preserving our investors' capital, the appropriate course of action was to sell
the funds' portfolio.5
Leverage and a perverse market combined forces to finish Sowood Capital.
Sowood started the month of July with more than $3 billion and after suffering investment
losses of more than 50 percent finished the month with approximately $1.5 billion. In the
hectic final days of Sowood's life, the firm reportedly sought assistance from Harvard
Management Company. Harvard refused. Sowood Capital-seeded by Harvard, staffed by
Harvard, and ultimately spurned by Harvard-taught Harvard a $350 million lesson on the
perils of leverage.
Granite Capital
Granite Capital's David Askin suffered devastating losses while pursuing an apparently
sophisticated strategy of identifying, hedging, and leveraging pricing anomalies in mortgaged-
backed securities derivatives. Based on a record of generating mid-teens returns with low
variability, Askin attracted funds from an impressive list of investors, including the Rockefeller
Foundation and McKinsey & Company. Unfortunately, explicit and implicit leverage caused
the firm's entire $600 million portfolio to be wiped out in a matter of weeks.
Askin invested in collateralized mortgage obligation derivatives with exotic names such as
super inverse interest only strips. As intimidating as the names might be, the securities
essentially constituted pieces of pools containing ordinary home mortgages. By combining
securities expected to respond in opposite ways to interest rate movements, Askin hoped to be
hedged-when rates move, profits on one part of the portfolio would more or less offset losses
on the other. If Askin correctly identified pricing anomalies, profits would exceed losses by a
margin equal to the mispricing.
Because mispricings in fixed income markets tend to be small, investors frequently use
leverage to magnify the portfolio impact of trades. At the time of his denouement, Askin
employed leverage of approximately two-and-one-half times, running positions of $2 billion on
$600 million of equity.
Askin's portfolio failed to weather the trauma created by the Federal Reserve's decision to
increase interest rates in early 1994. What appeared to be well-hedged positions in a benign
interest rate environment turned out to be wildly mismatched positions in a bearish bond
market. As Askin's portfolio accumulated losses, investment banks that had loaned money to
fund the positions seized the bonds, selling positions to cover their exposure. The combination
of poor portfolio structure and leverage led to Askin's downfall.
Askin sustained major losses because his hedges failed to perform. And yet, had he not been
leveraged, he likely would have survived the 1994 interest rate debacle. Losses of 30 percent on
a leveraged $2 billion portfolio wiped out $600 million of equity. Losses of 30 percent on a
$600 million unlevered portfolio would have reduced equity by a painful $180 million, but
investors would live to fight another day. In fact, subsequent to Askin's demise, prices of the
liquidated bonds recovered smartly. But by that time, Askin was no longer a player.!
Long-Term Capital Management
If the Guinness Book of World Records contained a category for hubris, the principals of Long-
Term Capital Management (LTCM) would top the list. Staffed by a combination of Wall Street
wizards and academic superstars (including two Nobel laureates), LTCM concocted a toxic
blend of arrogance and leverage that nearly brought down the world's financial system.
LTCM's business model involved investing in a broadly diversified pool of arbitrage
strategies, which attempted to exploit anomalies in the markets for equities, bonds, swaps,
futures, and a broad range of other derivatives. Using sophisticated financial models to
diversify overall portfolio risk, the firm believed that it had reduced risk to such a low level so as
to justify an extraordinarily high level of leverage.
LTCM's use of leverage defies imagination. In January 1998, well before the firm's July
collapse, LTCM's $4.8 billion of equity supported $120 billion of balance sheet positions,
representing leverage of approximately twenty-five to one. In fact, the irresponsible levels of
explicit leverage on the balance sheet represented only the tip of the iceberg.
LTCM's investment activities focused in large part on mispricings that could be exploited
through the use of derivative contracts. In many cases, the firm could obtain the desired
exposure with either cash instruments or derivatives, but used derivatives because of the
imbedded leverage. As a result, LTCM took on massive off-balance sheet positions. On a
market exposure basis, combining holdings both on balance sheet and off, LTCM had a total of
more than $1.4 trillion of positions supported by less than $5 billion of equity, representing
leverage of more than 290 to one.
When trouble arrived in the form of Russia's financial meltdown, LTCM's staggering
leverage quickly took the firm down. Even though a Wall Street bailout mitigated the damage,
the fund's losses were enormous. Roger Lowenstein, in his classic When Genius Failed,
described the ugly math:
Through April 1998, the value of a dollar invested in Long-Term quadrupled to $4.11.
By the time of the bailout, only five months later, precisely 33 cents of that total
remained. After deducting the partners' fees, the results were even sorrier: each invested
dollar, having grown to $2.85, shrank to a meager 23 cents. In net terms, the greatest
fund ever-surely the one with the highest IQs-had lost 77 percent of its capital while
the ordinary stock market investor had been more than doubling his money.
LTCM produced a portfolio of generally sensible investment positions. The fatal flaw in the
firm's strategy came from a nearly unimaginable degree of leverage; massive leverage magnified
the positive experience on the upside and similarly exaggerated the negative experience on the
downside. In contrast to LTCM, sensible investors employ leverage with great care, guarding
against a degree of risk that could threaten the viability of an investment program.
Security Lending
Some types of leverage, such as negative cash positions and explicit borrowing to increase
positions, exhibit themselves openly. Investment staff's prepare papers that investment
committees discuss, creating awareness of the general nature and magnitude of the borrowing.
Other forms of leverage remain hidden until trouble arises, causing damage to the portfolio too
late for corrective action.
Most large institutional investors conduct security loan programs, which involve lending
equity and debt securities to third parties, providing modest incremental income to the
investor. Security borrowers, generally Wall Street financial concerns, require the loans to create
short positions or cover failed trades. The security lender receives cash collateral to secure the
asset on loan, making that aspect of the transaction quite safe. The lender pays a below market
rate of interest on the cash collateral, expecting to reinvest the cash at a higher rate. The act of
reinvestment places the entire amount of the security lending transaction at risk in an effort to
generate the hoped-for spread between the below-market-rate borrowing and at-market-rate
lending.
Because the security lender retains ownership of securities on loan, along with the attendant
economic consequences, security lending activity produces little disruption to the portfolio.
Investors find it easy to forget about security lending, relegating it to back-office status. Security
lending rarely appears on investment committee agendas, treated like other functions
performed by custodian banks. If considered at all, committees likely view the process as a low
risk method of offsetting a portion of the bank custody fee.
Typical institutional deal structures exacerbate the unimpressive economics of security
lending. Custodian banks generally run security lending programs, splitting income with
investors on a seventy-thirty or sixty-forty basis, with the larger share accruing to security
lenders. Such profit sharing arrangements cause banks to seek risk, since they share in returns
without sharing in losses. The bank gets a good deal, carning a significant share of the profits
generated by putting client assets at risk. Investors get a raw deal, earning little in return for
exposing portfolio assets to meaningful downside.
The Common Fund
The Common Fund, an organization providing investment services to educational
institutions, learned in 1995 that its security lending program managed by First Capital
Strategists had incurred estimated losses of $128 million. Transgressions by a rogue trader,
Kent Ahrens, caused the losses that later calculations showed to be nearly $138 million.
According to Ahrens, in early 1992 he lost $250,000 on an equity index "arbitrage" trade.
Instead of closing out the position, he tried to offset the loss with speculative trading. After
more than three years of deception and fraud, Ahrens's cumulative losses reached a staggering
level.
The Common Fund security lending debacle hurt the firm in meaningful ways, tarnishing
its sterling reputation and causing large numbers of client defections. At June 30, 1995, the
Common Fund had $18.1 billion of marketable equity and fixed income assets under
management. One year later, assets amounted to $15.5 billion, a dramatic $5.2 billion, or 25
percent, less than would have been expected had asset levels simply kept pace with markets.
The First Capital Strategists story tells much more than the tale of a rogue trader. It
illustrates the risks in pursuing investment strategies with poor payoff structures, highlights
problems of monitoring certain types of trading activity, and shows dangers of inventive
schemes inappropriate for the nature of the investment activity.
Security lending activity at its best involves "make a little, make a little, make a little..." as
investors carn small positive spreads on security loans. Unfortunately, to "make a little" an
investor exposes a lot creating the possibility of "make a little, make a little, make a little, lose a
lot." This negatively skewed return pattern exhibits limited upside (make a little) with
substantial downside (lose a lot), representing an unattractive distribution of outcomes for
investors.
Decades ago, security lending exhibited more favorable characteristics. In the 1970s, when
security lenders paid no interest on cash collateral, extremely handsome returns resulted from
the activity. Since cash collateral secured the value of the asset on loan and the collateral could
be reinvested in U.S. Treasury bills, security lending participants faced essentially no risk.
*Make something, make something, make something" described the activity, while "lose a lot"
failed to register.
Structural changes and increased competition forced security lenders to pay interest on cash
collateral, ultimately causing reinvestment risk to enter the equation. When security lenders
could no longer create positive spreads by simply investing collateral in Treasury bills,
generating returns required accepting credit risk, interest rate risk, or even more exotic risks.
The Common Fund, through its relationship with First Capital Strategists, accepted these
risks with enthusiasm. Table 6.1 lists the wide range of authorized collateral reinvestment
strategies that the Common Fund employed beginning in the early 1980s. Alternatives ranged
from extremely conservative to quite aggressive. Equity index arbitrage, properly implemented,
poses little risk to invested assets. On the other end of the spectrum, Mexican broker
repurchase agreements embody substantial risks.
By following standard Wall Street practice of referring to many reinvestment strategies as
"arbitrages," the Common Fund promoted a false sense of security. Webster's Dictionary
defines arbitrage as "the often simultaneous purchase and sale of the same or equivalent
security (as in different markets) in order to profit from price discrepancies." In today's security
markets, occasional mispricings of futures contracts for stocks and bonds relative to cash
markets provide truc (albeit flecting) arbitrage opportunities. Other so-called arbitrages do not
involve "the same or equivalent security," thereby exposing assets to much more substantial
risk.

For example, convertible arbitrage involves owning a convertible bond and selling short the
stock of the issuing company to exploit perceived mispricings between relatively cheap bonds
and relatively expensive stock. Implementing convertible arbitrage requires dynamic hedging,
which may or may not be feasible, and assumption of unhedged residual interest rate and credit
risks. Under certain circumstances, convertible arbitrage offers attractive risk reward
relationships. Under no circumstance does convertible arbitrage create riskless returns.
At best, referring to risky strategies as arbitrages is a Wall Street conceit, an attempt to create
an aura of mystery and sophistication surrounding the investment process. At worst, the
practice constitutes deceptive advertising, an effort to lessen investor concerns surrounding
fundamentally risky activities.
A further problem with security lending activity concerns the high level of trading required.
Monitoring high levels of activity poses considerable challenges to the trading organization,
outside investors, and other responsible professionals, such as lawyers and accountants. When
investment positions turn over several times daily, supervisors can only trust that traders
faithfully implement strategies and follow guidelines. Investors can only trust that supervisors
monitor the process carefully. High levels of trading activity create difficult control issues.
In contrast, long-term investment activity raises fewer monitoring issues. Security positions
held for months or years generate far less control risk than positions held for minutes or hours.
Moreover, the temptation to hide losing trade tickets in a drawer or to violate guidelines to
trade out of losses seems more consistent with the speculative mindset of a trader than with the
temperate attitude of an investor. In fact, many of the 1990s' most sensational losses resulted
from the activity of rogue traders such as Nicholas Leeson, who brought down Barings PLC;
Toshihide Igushi, who caused Daiwa Bank to be exiled from the United States; and Robert
Citron, who forced Orange County into bankruptcy. While avoiding trading strategies
provides no guarantee against fraud, pursuing longer term investment programs lessens control
risks for fiduciaries.
Poor deal structure contributed to the dangers of the Common Fund's security lending
program. First Capital Strategists earned between 25 percent and 33 percent of profits
generated by putting the Common Fund member institutions' funds at risk. In essence, First
Capital flipped coins in a "heads I win, tails you lose" game. Since the firm did not share in
losses, employees had strong incentive to recommend and pursue risky strategies.
Poor incentives provide only a partial explanation of the problem. The Common Fund
knowingly participated in First Capital Strategists' risk-secking activity. Prior to the Kent
Ahrens debacle, two events brought the risky nature of the reinvestment vehicles to the fore. In
August 1987, First Capital incurred a loss of $2.5 million by speculating on an aborted hostile
takeover of Caesar's World. While First Capital reimbursed the Common Fund for the loss, the
transaction highlighted risks involved in corporate restructuring "arbitrage." Later, beginning
in September 1989, First Capital accumulated a position in the ill-fated employee-led attempt
to take over United Airlines. Ultimately liquidated at a loss of $2.6 million to the Common
Fund, the trade caused security lending for fiscal year 1990 to show a loss of $577,600. The
Caesar's World and United Airlines incidents forced trustees of the Common Fund to be
acutely aware of the risks associated with the firm's security lending program.
In essence, the Common Fund leveraged its assets by participating in security lending,
borrowing funds (the cash collateral), and securing the loans with Common Fund member
institution stocks and bonds. First Capital invested proceeds from the loans in risky vehicles,
hoping to generate positive returns. While dangers inherent in trading activities and problems
associated with poor deal structure provide the most visible contribution to the Common
Fund's disaster, the root of the problem originates with the inappropriate use of the leverage
implicit in the security lending program.
CONCLUSION
Placing asset allocation targets at the center of the portfolio management process increases the
likelihood of investment success. Disciplined rebalancing techniques produce portfolios that
reflect articulated risk and return characteristics. Less rigorous approaches to portfolio
management almost guarantee that actual asset allocation differs from desired levels, leading to
outcomes less likely to satisfy institutional goals.
Attractive investment opportunities frequently contain elements of illiquidity, introducing
some rigidities into a portfolio's asset allocation. By inducing investors to hold positions
inconsistent with targeted levels, illiquid assets cause overall portfolio characteristics to deviate
from desired levels, creating challenges for disciplined rebalancing activity.
Pursuit of active management introduces friction between investment results and
benchmark returns. Sensible investors take great care in identifying portfolio biases, ensuring
that differences result from deliberate choices, not inadvertent consequences of portfolio
construction. Normal portfolios and completeness funds assist managers in understanding and
controlling active management bets.
While successful active management programs eventually create value, investors face the
interim possibility of experiencing periods of underperformance. Many sensible investment
strategies require time horizons of three to five years, introducing the likelihood that even
ultimately correct decisions appear foolish in the short run. When market prices move against
already established positions, investors with strong hands add to holdings, increasing the
benefit from active management. Conversely, sensible investors trim winning positions,
preventing excessive exposure to recently successful strategies. Leaning against the wind proves
to be an effective risk control measure.
Leverage contains the potential to add substantial value and create great harm, posing
particular danger to investors pursuing long-term strategies. Keynes warns that "... an investor
who proposes to ignore market fluctuations... must not operate on so large a scale, if at all,
with borrowed money." Fiduciaries strive to identify and assess sources of explicit and implicit
portfolio leverage, seeking to ensure that the leverage influences the portfolio in an acceptable
manner.
Many high profile investment disasters of recent years stem from leverage lurking beneath
the superficial portfolio characteristics. The Common Fund made explicit use of leverage in its
risk-seeking security lending program, exposing educational institution assets to high levels of
risk in exchange for modest expected returns. David Askin employed explicit leverage on top of
the implicit leverage inherent in his mortgage-backed securities derivatives positions, turning
an otherwise serious impairment of value into a total wipcout. Avoiding headline grabbing
disaster requires thorough understanding of the sources and magnitude of exposure to
leverage.
Serving institutional goals requires disciplined implementation of asset allocation policies,
centered on regular rebalancing to ensure that portfolio characteristics match targeted levels.
Many activities pursued by institutional fund managers create frictions that cause portfolio
results to differ from expectations. Illiquid investments often provide attractive active
management opportunities, while posing significant challenges to the rebalancing process.
Investors employing active management strategies expose funds to the impact of performance
differentials relative to benchmark results. Use of leverage magnifies investment results,
potentially altering portfolio characteristics in a manner unanticipated by asset allocation
analyses. Sensible investors rebalance regularly, carefully consider active management, and limit
leverage.
1. Even though with an unlevered portfolio Askin may not have gone out of business, without leverage Askin never
would have been in business. Leverage boosted the underlying returns on his strategy to the mid teens level necessary
to attract investment capital.7
Traditional Asset Classes
The definition of an asset class employs both art and science in an attempt to combine like
with like, secking as an end result a relatively homogenous collection of investment
opportunities. Appropriately defined asset classes include groups of positions that collectively
provide a coherent contribution to an investor's portfolio.
Traditional asset classes share a number of critical attributes. First, traditional asset classes
contribute basic, valuable, differentiable characteristics to an investment portfolio. Second,
traditional holdings rely fundamentally on market-generated returns, not on active
management of portfolios. Third, traditional asset classes derive from broad, deep, investable
markets.
The basic, valuable, differentiable characteristics contributed by traditional asset classes
range from provision of substantial expected returns to protection against financial crises.
Careful investors define asset class exposures narrowly enough to ensure that the investment
vehicle accomplishes its expected task, but broadly enough to encompass a critical mass of
assets.
Traditional asset classes rely fundamentally on market-generated returns, providing
reasonable certainty that various portfolio constituents fulfill their appointed missions. In
those cases where active management proves essential to the success of a particular asset class,
the investor relies on unusual ability or good fortune to produce results. If an active manager
exhibits poor skill or experiences bad luck, the investor suffers as the asset class fails to achieve
its goals. Because traditional asset classes depend on market-driven returns, investors need not
rely on serendipity or the supposed expertise of market players.
Traditional holdings trade in broad, decep, investable markets. Market breadth promises an
extensive array of choices. Market depth implics a substantial volume of offerings for individual
positions. Market investability assures access by investors to investment opportunities.
Traditional asset classes occupy well-established, enduring marketplaces.
Traditional asset classes encompass stocks and bonds. Asset classes that investors employ to
drive portfolio returns include domestic equity, forcign developed market cquity, and emerging
market equity. Equity exposure can be diversified by holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds, which
promise protection from financial catastrophe. Traditional asset classes provide several of the
basic building blocks required by investors to create a well-diversified portfolio.
Descriptions of traditional asset classes help investors understand the role that various
investment vehicles play in a portfolio. By assessing an asset class's expected returns and risks,
likely response to inflation, and anticipated interaction with other asset classes, investors
develop the knowledge required to build a portfolio. An outline of issues surrounding
alignment of interests between issuers of securities and owners of securities illustrates the
potential pitfalls and possible benefits of participating in certain asset categories.
DOMESTIC EQUITY
Investment in domestic equities represents ownership of a piece of corporate America.
Holdings of U.S. stocks constitute the core of most institutional and individual portfolios,
causing Wall Street's ups and downs to drive investment results for many investors. While a
large number of market participants rely far too heavily on marketable equitics, U.S. stocks
deserve a prominent position in investment portfolios.
Domestic stocks play a central role in investment portfolios for good theoretical and
practical reasons. The expected return characteristics of equity instruments match nicely with
the need to generate substantial portfolio growth over the sweep of time. To the extent that
history provides a guide, long-term returns encourage investors to own stocks. Jeremy Siegel's
203 years of data show U.S. stocks earning 8.4 percent per annum, while Roger Ibbotson's
eighty years of data show stocks earning 11.1 percent per annum.! No other asset class
possesses such an impressive record of long-term performance.
The long-term success of equity-dominated portfolios matches expectations formed from
fundamental financial principles. Equity investments promise higher returns than bond
investments, although in the short run the prospect of higher returns sometimes remains
unfulfilled. Not surprisingly, the historical record of generally strong equity market returns
contains several extended periods that remind investors of the downside of equity ownership.
In the corporate capital structure, equity represents a residual interest that exhibits value only
after accounting for all other claims against the company. The higher risk of equity positions
leads rational investors to demand higher expected returns.
Stocks exhibit a number of attractive characteristics that stimulate investor interest.
Interests of shareholders and corporate management tend to be aligned, allowing outside
owners of shares some measure of comfort that corporate actions will benefit both
shareholders and management. Stocks generally provide protection against unexpected
increases in inflation, although the protection proves notoriously unreliable in the short run.
Finally, stocks trade in broad, deep, liquid markets, affording investors access to an impressive
range of opportunities. Equity investments deserve a thorough discussion, since in many
respects they represent the standard against which market observers evaluate all other
investment alternatives.
Equity Risk Premium
The equity risk premium, defined as the incremental return to equity holders for accepting risk
above the level inherent in bond investments, represents one of the investment world's most
critically important variables. Like all forward-looking metrics, the expected risk premium
stands shrouded in the uncertainties of the future. To obtain clues about what tomorrow may
have in store, thoughtful investors examine the characteristics of the past.
Yale School of Management Professor Roger Ibbotson produces a widely used set of capital
market statistics that reflect an eighty-year stock-and-bond return differential of 5.7 percent per
annum.1 Wharton Professor Jeremy Siegel's 203 years of data show a risk premium of 3.0
percent per annum.2 Regardless of the precise number, historical risk premia indicate that
equity owners enjoyed a substantial return advantage over bondholders."
The size of the risk premium proves critically important in the asset allocation decision.
While history provides a guide, careful investors interpret past results with care. Work on
survivorship bias by Phillipe Jorion and William Goetzmann demonstrates the unusual nature
of the U.S. equity market experience. The authors examine the experience of thirty-nine
markets over a seventy-five-year period, noting that "(m)ajor disruptions have afflicted nearly all
of the markets in our sample, with the exception of a few such as the United States."3
The more-or-less uninterrupted operation of the U.S. stock market in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries contributed to superior results. Jorion and Goetzmann find that the U.S.
market produced 4.3 percent annualized real capital appreciation from 1921 to 1996. In
contrast, the other countries, many of which experienced economic and military trauma,
posted a median real appreciation of only 0.8 percent per year. Thoughtful market observers
place the exceptional experience of the U.S. equity markets in a broader, less-compelling
context.
Even if investors accept U.S. market history as definitive, reasons exist to doubt the value of
the past as a guide to the future. Consider stock market performance over the past two
hundred years. The returns consist of a combination of dividends, inflation, real growth in
dividends, and rising valuation levels. According to an April 2003 study by Robert Arnott,
aptly titled "Dividends and the Three Dwarfs," dividends provide the greatest portion of long-
term equity returns. Of the Arnott study's two-hundred-year 7.9 percent annualized total
return from equities, fully 5.0 percentage points come from dividends. Inflation accounts for
1.4 percentage points, real dividend growth accounts for 0.8 percentage points, and rising
evaluation accounts for 0.6 percentage points. Arnott points out that the overwhelming
importance of dividends to historical returns "is wildly at odds with conventional wisdom,
which suggests that ... stocks provide growth first and income second."
Arnott uses his historical observations to draw some inferences for the future. He
concludes, with dividend yields below 2.0 percent (in April 2003), that unless real growth in
dividends accelerates or equity market valuations rise, investors face a future far less
remunerative than the past. (Note that in August 2007 the dividend yield of the S&P 500
stood at 1.75 percent). Observing that real dividends showed no growth from 1965 to 2002,
Arnott holds out little hope of dividend increases driving future equity returns. The alternative
of relying on increases in valuations assigned to corporate carnings for future equity market
growth serves as a thin reed upon which to build a portfolio.
Simple extrapolation of past returns into the future assumes implicitly that past valuation
changes will persist in the future. In the specific case of the U.S. stock market, expectations that
history provides a guide to the future suggest that dividends will grow at unprecedented rates
or ever-higher valuations will be assigned to corporate earnings. Investors relying on such
forecasts depend not only on the fundamental earning power of corporations, but also on the
stock market's continued willingness to increase the price paid for corporate profits.
As illogical as it seems, one popular bull market tome published in 1999 espoused the view
that equity valuation would continue to increase unabated, arguing for a zero equity risk
premium. Advancing the notion that over long periods of time equities always outperform
bonds, in Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting from the Coming Rise in the Stock
Market, James Glassman and Kevin Hassett conclude that equities exhibit no more risk than
bonds.5 The authors ignore the intrinsic differences between stocks and bonds that clearly
point to greater risk in stocks. The authors fail to consider experiences outside of the United
States where equity markets have on occasion disappeared, leading to questions about the
inevitability of superior results from long-term equity investment. Perhaps most important,
the authors overestimate the number of investors that operate with twenty- or thirty-year time
horizons and underestimate the number of investors that fail to stay the course when equity
markets falter.
Finance theory and capital markets history provide analytical and practical underpinnings
to the notion of a risk premium. Without expectations of superior returns for risky assets, the
financial world would be turned on its head. In the absence of higher expected returns for
fundamentally riskier stocks, market participants would shun equitics. For example, in a world
where bonds and stocks share identical expected returns, rational investors would opt for the
equal-expected-return, lower-risk bonds. No investor would hold equal-expected-return,
higher-risk stocks. The risk premium must exist for capital markets to function effectively.
While an expected risk premium proves necessary for well-functioning markets, Jorion and
Goetzmann highlight the influence of survivorship bias on perceptions of the magnitude of the
risk premium. Arnott's deconstruction of equity returns and analysis of historical trends
suggest a diminished prospective return advantage for stocks over bonds. Regardless of the
future of the risk premium, sensible investors prepare for a future that differs from the past,
with diversification providing the most powerful protection against errors in forecasts of
expected asset class attributes.
Stock Prices and Inflation
Stocks tend to offer long-term protection against generalized price inflation. A simple, yet
elegant, means of understanding stock prices developed by Nobel laureate James Tobin
compares the replacement cost of corporate assets to the market value of those assets. In
equilibrium, Tobin argued that the ratio of replacement-cost-to-market value, which he named
"q" should equal one. If replacement cost exceeds market valuc, economic actors find it
cheaper to buy assets on the stock exchange than in the real economy. Conversely, if market
value exceeds replacement cost, economic actors generate profits by building companies and
floating shares on the stock exchange. Clearly, in rational markets, the value of corporate assets
on a stock exchange should equal the real world replacement cost of those selfsame assets.
To the extent that general price inflation increases the replacement cost of corporate assets,
that inflation should be reflected in increasing stock prices. If inflation did not result in higher
equity prices, the newly inflated replacement cost of assets would exceed market value, allowing
investors to purchase companies on the stock exchange at below intrinsic value. Until and
unless stock prices reflect price inflation, publicly traded companies represent bargain
basement merchandise.
In spite of the clear theoretical link between stock prices and inflation, the stock market
presents a mixed record on incorporating inflation into equity prices. The 1970s provide a
dramatic example of equity market failure to reflect rising price levels in stock prices. In 1973
and 1974, inflation croded purchasing power by 37 percent and stock prices decreased by a
total of 22 percent, hitting equity investors with a double whammy that caused losses of 51
percent in inflation-adjusted terms.
Jeremy Siegel observes that stock prices "provide excellent long-run hedges against inflation"
and weak short-term protection against rising prices. Presumably, the positive long-term
relationship between inflation and stock prices stems from rational behavior, as market
participants weigh the costs of acquiring assets in the real economy against the costs of
acquiring similar assets on the financial exchanges. Possibly, the negative short-term
relationship between inflation and stock prices results from irrational behavior, as investors
respond to unanticipated inflation by increasing the discount rate applied to future cash flows
without adjusting those future flows for the increases in inflation. While capital markets
history supports Siegel's observation, the difference in short-run and long-run responses by
equity prices to inflation creates a paradox. Because the long run consists of a series of short
runs, no theory explains both the poor short-term record and the strong long-term record of
stock price protection against price increases. In any event, investors seeking short-term shelter
from inflation need to look beyond holdings of marketable equities.
Alignment of Interests
Stocks exhibit a number of characteristics that tend to serve investor goals. The general
alignment of interests between corporate managers and shareholders bodes well for stock
investors. In most instances, company executives benefit from enhancing shareholder value,
serving the financial aspirations of management and investor alike. For example, corporate
managers often share in gains associated with greater corporate profitability, indirectly through
increased compensation and directly through increased values for personal shareholdings.
Unfortunately, the separation of ownership (by shareholders) and control (by management)
in publicly traded companies introduces agency problems that occur when managements (the
agents) benefit at the expense of shareholders (the principals). The most common wedge
between interests of shareholders and management stems from compensation arrangements for
management. High levels of salary and benefits accrue to management regardless of the level of
underlying company achievement. Because larger companies provide larger compensation
packages than smaller enterprises, corporate managers pursue corporate growth simply to
achieve higher levels of personal earnings regardless of the impact of corporate size on
enterprise profitability.
Managements divert funds to purposes that satisfy personal preferences at the expense of
corporate performance. Company art collections, business jets, lavish offices, and corporate
apartments confer benefits on senior managers at the expense of legitimate company goals.
Investors cringe upon reading stories regarding WorldCom chief executive Bernard Ebbers's
receipt of more than $400 million of personal loans from the company and Tyco chief
executive Dennis Kozlowski's diversion of $600 million of company assets for personal
purposes, including the purchase of a $6,000 shower curtain. Outsized financial and
nonfinancial rewards for management, whether legitimate or otherwise, come directly from the
pockets of company shareholders.
Yet, the most troubling scandal lies not with the chief executives that crossed the line, but
with those that feathered their beds while following the rules. Former General Electric chief
executive Jack Welch brought shame on himself and his company with a retirement package
filled with personal perquisites. Beginning with lifetime use of a $15 million apartment bought
by General Electric, the list includes access to the company's Boeing 737 jets, corporate
helicopters, and a car and driver for him and his wife. No doubt worried that the hundreds of
millions of dollars paid to Mr. Welch during his tenure at General Electric proved inadequate
to support his retirement, the company provided "wine, flowers, cook, housekeeper and other
amenities, including tickets to "top sporting events and the opera," to cater to the former
chief executive's needs.7 Even the reliably business-friendly editorial pages of the Wall Street
Journal characterized Mr. Welch's retirement package as "the playthings of corporate
opulence."8
The compensation excess exemplified by Ebbers, Kozlowski, and Welch represents the tip of
the iceberg. The deeper problem, as described by William McDonough, president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, lies in the fact that rapid increases in chief executive
compensation in the past two decades represent "terribly bad social policy and perhaps even
bad morals." McDonough suggested that corporate boards "should simply reach the
conclusion that corporate pay is excessive and adjust it to more reasonable and justifiable
levels."9
Stock Options
The use of stock options to reward corporate management produces a subtle disconnect
between the interests of management and shareholders. Options-based compensation schemes
work effectively when company share prices increase, as both management and shareholders
gain. The alignment of interests breaks down when share prices decrease, as management loses
only the opportunity to benefit from stock price increases. In fact, management fails to suffer
at all when corporate boards reset option prices to reflect the newly diminished stock price. In
sharp contrast to management's loss of a mere opportunity, when share prices decrease
shareholders lose cold, hard cash. Options-based compensation schemes represent a no-lose
game for management of publicly traded companics.
Microsoft provides a textbook example of using option grants to insulate employees from
share price declines. In April 2000, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer faced a problem of low
morale among employees concerned about the consequences of the Justice Department's
antitrust activity and a four-month, 44 percent stock price decline. To boost spirits, Ballmer
awarded more than 34,000 Microsoft employees stock options priced at the then current stock
price. The chief executive wrote in an email to employees that we know stock options are an
important part of our compensation. Even while asserting that preexisting options "will have
valuc long run," Ballmer expressed his hope that "these new grants will let people see returns
much sooner."10 By setting the option strike price near the stock's fifty-two week low, the
company effectively insulated employees from the dramatic decline in Microsoft's shares. The
company provided no such succor to shareholders.
In response to the all-too-numerous abuses of trust in the late 1990s, many corporations
began to review options-based compensation. In a particularly notable move, in July 2003,
Microsoft announced plans to climinate its options program and substitute a program of
restricted stock awards. Unlike the asymmetric option payoff, restricted stock produces a
congruence of outcomes in which management and shareholders profit and suffer together.
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer remarked, "whether it's dividend policy or how much risk to
take, it's always good to have the employees thinking as much like the shareholders as
possible. If substantial numbers of corporations follow Microsoft's lead, corporate
management will likely better serve shareholder interests in the future.
In spite of a general alignment of interests between shareholders and company managers,
too many abuses exist. Excessive executive compensation, whether in the direct form of inflated
salaries or the indirect form of unreasonable corporate perquisites, lines the pockets of
corporate managers at the expense of shareholders. Sometimes, as in the case of options-based
compensation, a disconnect exists between management and shareholders. One sure way to
reduce the conflict between the owners of shares and the managers of companies involves
ownership of stock by corporate management. Savvy investors seek companies with high levels
of insider ownership.
Market Characteristics
At December 31, 2006, the U.S. stock market boasted assets in excess of $18.2 trillion, making
it the largest liquid capital market in the world. More than 6,190 securities constituted the
market, as defined by the (misnamed) Wilshire 5000. The enormous size of the U.S. stock
market prompts many participants to divide the whole into any number of parts. Typical
categories include size of market capitalization (small, medium, and large), character of security
(growth or value), and nature of business (utility, technology, and health care, for example). At
year-end 2006, the U.S. stock market traded at a dividend yield of 1.7 percent, a price-carnings
ratio of 19.5 and a price-book ratio of 2.5.12
Summary
U.S. domestic equities represent the asset of choice for many long-term investors. Finance
theory predicts and practical experience demonstrates that stocks provide superior returns over
reasonably long holding periods. The general alignment of interests between shareholders and
management serves both the goals of outside owners and the aspirations of inside managers.
Holdings of equitics provide protection against inflation in the intermediate and long run.
Attractive characteristics of equity holdings arguc for a significant role in most portfolios.
Yet investors must guard against relying on equities to exhibit their general characteristics in
any specific time frame or allowing equities to account for too large a portion of the target
portfolio. History may overstate the attractiveness of U.S. stocks. Returns of bonds and cash
may exceed returns of stocks for years on end. For example, from the market peak in October
1929, it took stock investors fully twenty-one years and three months to match returns
generated by bond investors. 13 Alignment of interests between shareholders and management
breaks down with distressing frequency. Stock prices often fail to reflect underlying price
inflation, at times for extended periods. Although equity markets do not deliver returns in a
steady, stable, inflation-hedging fashion and corporate managements sometimes fail to serve
shareholder interests, equity investments remain a central part of thoughtfully assembled, long-
term-oriented investment portfolios.
U.S. TREASURY BONDS
Purchasers of U.S. Treasury bonds own a portion of the public debt of the United States
government. Holdings of government bonds play a prominent role in well-structured fixed
income portfolios, reflecting the attractive investment characteristics of full-faith-and-credit
obligations of the government and the significant volume of debt securities issued by the
government.
Because U.S. Treasury bonds enjoy the full-faith-and-credit backing of the U.S.
government, bondholders face no risk of default. Holders of government debt sleep secure in
the knowledge that interest and principal payments will be made in full and in a timely
manner. Lack of default risk does not, however, liberate bondholders from exposure to price
fluctuations. When interest rates risc, bond prices fall, as purchasers of existing assets need an
adjustment to reflect the now-higher rates available on newly issued debt. When interest rates
fall, bonds prices rise, as sellers of existing assets require greater compensation for their now-
more-attractive fixed stream of future payments. Of all risky investments, investors expect the
lowest returns from U.S. Treasury bonds, due to the high degree of security intrinsic in
obligations of the U.S. government.
Interest Rate Risk
Bonds confuse investors. The inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices (rates
up, prices down and vice versa) proves central to understanding the role of fixed income in an
investment portfolio. Yet surveys show that a large majority of investors fail to grasp even the
most basic elements of bond math. Even highly respected market observers sometimes get it
wrong. An article in the New York Times business section ironically entitled "Better
Understanding of Bonds" asserted that "duration and bond prices move in lockstep with
interest rates. A bond with a duration of seven years would gain 7 percent of its price when
interest rates moved up one percentage point. The same bond would lose 7 percent when rates
moved down that amount."14 Of course, the Times described the relationship between prices
and yields in perfectly perverse prose. Increases in interest rates cause price declines, not price
increases. If a highly regarded, financially sophisticated New York Times business reporter
cannot get it right, what chance does an ordinary investor have?
Duration measures the effective maturity of a bond, considering the timing and present
value of individual cash flows received over the term of the instrument. V Longer duration
bonds exhibit greater sensitivity to interest rate changes than do shorter duration bonds. By
increasing a portfolio's duration, investors gain greater exposure to interest rate moves, creating
a roughly equivalent choice between more assets with lower duration and fewer assets with
higher duration. Portfolio managers wishing to reduce the opportunity costs of holding fixed
income assets might rely on a small allocation to a long duration portfolio, in essence buying
the diversifying power of bonds on the cheap.
In the realm of U.S. Treasury bond investing, risk relates primarily to time horizon. An
investor with a six-month time horizon finds six-month Treasury bills riskless, as no doubt
exists about the timely payment of the face value of the bill at maturity. That same six-month-
time-horizon investor finds ten-year Treasury notes quite risky. As interest rates change, the
value of the note might vary materially, even over a six-month holding period. An increase in
rates leaves the investor with a loss, while a decline in rates provides the investor with an
unexpected windfall.
Similarly, an investor with a ten-year time horizon faces significant risk with six-month
Treasury bill investments. The six-month bills must be rolled over nineteen times to generate a
ten-year holding period return. At the outset, the investor knows the rate only on the first six-
month bill. The nineteen future rollover rates hold considerable uncertainty. Unless investors
match holding period with maturity, price changes or rate changes may cause returns to diverge
from expected levels.
Diversifying Power
U.S. Treasury securities provide a unique form of diversification for investor portfolios,
protecting against financial crisis and economic distress. In the stock market collapse of
October 1987, when the U.S. stock market plummeted more than 20 percent in a single day,
investors sought the safe haven of U.S. Treasury obligations. Even as stock prices fell off of a
cliff, Treasury bonds staged an impressive rally. During the economic distress surrounding the
confluence of the 1998 Asian, Russian, and American capital markets crises, investors engaged
in a "flight to quality," favoring the security of U.S. Treasury obligations. Similarly, amid the
credit crunch of August 2007, Treasury bill yields dropped two full percentage points in a
matter of days to an intraday low of 2.5 percent. At that time, the spread between LIBOR and
Treasury bills amounted to a stunning three percentage points, fully four times the average
spread that prevailed for the month of June 2007. In times of crisis, government securities
provide the greatest degree of protection to investor portfolios.
The protection to portfolio values provided by government bonds comes at a high price.
Expected returns for fixed income instruments fall short of expected returns for equity-
oriented investments. Some investors attempt to mitigate the opportunity costs of owning
government bonds by holding higher-yielding corporate paper. Unfortunately,
nongovernment bonds exhibit characteristics such as credit risk, illiquidity, and optionality
that reduce effectiveness as a hedge against financial distress. The purity of noncallable, long-
term, default-free Treasury bonds provides the most powerful diversification to investor
portfolios.
Panic of 1998
In the summer and early fall of 1998, the Asian financial crisis painted a bleak backdrop for
securities markets. A mid-July slump in cquity markets accelerated in August when
devaluation and default in Russia contributed to investor anxiety. The near collapse in
September of the insanely levered Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund fueled bearish
sentiment, causing market participants to demand immediate liquidity and safety.
During the worldwide collapse in equity prices, as shown in Figure 7.1, the broad-based
Wilshire 5000 declined 22 percent from its all time peak on July 17th to the market bottom on
October 8th. Reflecting a strong preference for quality and size, large-capitalization stocks
outperformed small securities in dramatic fashion with the S&P 500 outpacing the Russell
2000 by a margin of 14 percent, or-19 percent to -33 percent. Developed foreign and emerging
equity returns provided little solace for diversified portfolios, with the markets falling 21
percent and 27 percent, respectively.
Amid the market tumult, long-term Treasuries posted solid gains, returning 8 percent and
besting the results of every major asset class. Credit risk and optionality dampened the
performance of high quality corporate bonds and mortgages, limiting returns to 5 percent and
2 percent, respectively. Junk bonds and emerging debt produced losses, reflecting the high
degree of equity exposure implicit in risky bond positions. High yield posted a-7 percent
return and emerging markets generated a dismal -24 percent result over the period.
Asset class performance surrounding the 1998 market panic illustrates the superior
diversifying power of pure fixed income-long-term, noncallable, default-free. Under normal
circumstances, credit exposure and option risk increase returns; in times of crisis, U.S. Treasury
bonds provide the protection that investors require.

Bond Prices and Inflation
To add a further measure of complexity to the world of bond investing, investors in traditional
U.S. Treasury bonds observe only nominal returns. In some instances, investors care primarily
about nominal returns. For example, if a debtor desires to pay off a fixed obligation, the debtor
requires only the amount of the debt, nothing more and nothing less. Nominally denominated
investments, like Treasury bonds, match nominal liabilities nicely. If, on the other hand, an
institution hopes to maintain the purchasing power of endowment assets, that institution
needs to keep pace with inflation. Inflation-sensitive investments, unlike Treasury bonds, fulfill
inflation-sensitive requirements. For holders of traditional Treasury debt securities, changes in
inflation rates influence after-inflation returns in unpredictable ways, leading to potential
variation between anticipated and actual outcomes.
Investors price fixed income instruments to generate positive inflation-adjusted rates of
return. When the inflation rates experienced by investors more or less match the expectations
formed at the beginning of the holding period, bondholders receive the anticipated after-
inflation return. When inflation rates exceed expectations, the unanticipated inflation crodes
the purchasing power of the promised stream of fixed payments, causing investors to receive
disappointing after-inflation returns. When inflation rates fall short of expectations, the lower
rate of general price inflation provides investors with a purchasing power boost. Deviations
between original inflationary expectations and actual experience contain the potential to cause
dramatic changes in real returns for fixed income investors.
When inflationary expectations fail to match actual experience, bonds tend to behave
differently from other financial assets. Unanticipated inflation crushes bonds, while ultimately
benefiting equities. Unanticipated deflation boosts bonds, while undermining stocks. Bonds
provide the greatest diversification relative to equities in cases where actual inflation differs
dramatically from expected levels.
Alignment of Interests
Interests of Treasury bond investors and the U.S. government prove to be better aligned than
interests of corporate bond investors and corporate issuers. The government sees little reason
to disfavor bondholders. In essence, action taken to reduce the value of government bonds
represents a transfer from bondholders to non-bondholders. In fact, if all debt were held
domestically, advantages or disadvantages accruing to the government from changes in bond
values would balance equal-and-offsetting disadvantages or advantages accruing to
bondholders, leading to transfers from one group of citizens (taxpayers or bondholders) to
another group of citizens (bondholders or taxpayers). Moreover, were the government to
disadvantage bond investors, future access to credit markets might be impaired. Worry over
misalignment of interests causes little lost sleep for owners of Treasury bonds.
Investors in Treasury bonds generally perceive the government as a neutral player in the debt
management process. Unlike corporate debtholders, who sit squarely across the table from the
issuers of corporate obligations, government bondholders expect fair treatment. Consider the
fact that from 1975 to 1984, the U.S. Treasury offered a dozen issues of thirty-year bonds that
contained call provisions for the final five years of the issue's life. A call provision allows the
debt issuer to redeem a debt issue at a fixed price. Economically motivated issuers exercise call
provisions only when the fixed-call price stands below the value of the bond calculated in
absence of a call provision. Exercise of a call provision eliminates debt with high coupons
relative to current market levels, benefiting the issuer and hurting the investor.
Because of the special nature of the government's role in debt markets, bond market
participants debated whether the government would employ the call option for debt
management purposes or for economic refundings. If the government used the call option for
debt management, then bondholders faced an idiosyncratic risk as likely to provide a benefit as
a cost. If the government used the call option for economic refundings, then bondholders faced
a risk of economic loss.
Government bondholders received the answer to the question of how the Treasury would
behave on January 14, 2000 when the Treasury "announced the call for redemption at par on
May 15, 2000 of the 8-1/4% Treasury Bonds of 2000-05."15 The government responded to
economic incentives, calling high-interest debt to reduce financing charges.
In later refundings, the U.S. Treasury explicitly cited an economic motivation for calling
bonds. In the unimaginatively titled January 15, 2004 Public Debt News release, "Treasury Calls
9-1/8 Percent Bonds of 2004-09," the government noted that "these bonds are being called to
reduce the cost of debt financing. The 9-1/8 percent interest rate is significantly above the
current cost of securing financing for the five years remaining to their maturity. In current
market conditions, Treasury estimates that interest savings from the call and refinancing will be
about $544 million."16 In other words, the ability to refinance the 9-percent-plus-coupon
bonds at an interest cost of between 3 percent and 4 percent resulted in substantial interest
savings for the government.
Even though the government acted in an economic fashion by exercising the call provision
on the 9-1/8s Treasury bonds of 2004-09, the fact that investors debated whether the
government would exercise the call provision to generate interest savings signifies the unusual
relationship between the government and its creditors. In fact, the program of callable Treasury
issuance lasted a mere ten years and involved a relatively small portion of overall government
bond issuance. Moreover, the call provisions affected only the last five years of the thirty-year
bond's life, in contrast to the much more aggressive call provisions typically included in issues
of long-term corporate debt. Perhaps the U.S. Treasury stopped selling callable bonds to
improve the character of securities offered to government bond market participants. In any
event, of all debt issuers, the government promotes the greatest alignment of interests with its
creditors.
At December 31, 2006, roughly 31 percent of U.S. government bond issues represented
debt issued by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). (The Government National
Mortgage Association, known as "Ginnic Mac," the Federal Home Loan and Mortgage
Corporation, known as "Freddie Mac," and the Federal National Mortgage Association,
known as "Fannic Mac," constitute the largest GSEs.) Many market participants treat debt
issued by GSEs as close substitutes for U.S. Treasury obligations. In fact, credit quality of GSES
ranges from the full-faith-and-credit status enjoyed by Ginnie Mac to the less exalted status of
Fannie Mac and Freddie Mac. Many GSEs operate in a nether land between the certainty of
government guarantees and the uncertainty of corporate promises to pay. While chances of
default by GSEs seem quite low to most market observers, many GSE obligations contain
options that may disadvantage bondholders.
Investors seeking the purity of U.S. Treasury debt face a surprisingly daunting task. Many
high quality bond investment vehicles hold large quantities of GSE debt, as fund managers
pursue the time-honored investment practice of hoping to get something for nothing in the
form of incremental yield on GSE paper (the something) without exposing the portfolio to
additional risk (the nothing). The twin possibilitics of credit deterioration and exercise of
options by the GSEs carry the potential to harm bondholder interests. Investors secking high
quality fixed income exposure avoid GSE debt and opt for the purity of U.S. Treasury bonds,
the full-faith-and-credit obligations of the U.S. government.
Cash
Investors frequently divide fixed income assets into cash and bonds, with the former consisting
of instruments maturing within one year, and the latter including instruments with more than
a year to maturity. For investors with short investment horizons, cash represents the riskless
asset as market participants know nominal and real returns with reasonable certainty. Certainty
of return comes with a high price as returns over the eighty-one years through December 31,
2006 amount to a mere 3.7 percent per annum for cash, which falls to a paltry 0.7 percent per
year after adjustment for inflation.
Because investors frequently employ one-year horizons when conducting portfolio analysis,
cash naturally enters the matrix of capital markets returns, causing many long-term investors to
misidentify cash holdings as a riskless asset. If investors conducted analysis over periods
consistent with an appropriate investment horizon, cash would appear as a substantially riskier
asset.
Some investors argue that cash provides necessary liquidity for endowment funds, ignoring
the massive amounts of liquidity resident in institutional portfolios. Interest income, dividend
payments, and rental streams provide liquid cash flows, facilitating the ability of the investment
fund to meet spending distribution requirements. Natural turnover of assets provides another
source of funds. Bonds mature, companies merge, and private assets become liquid, serving as
sources of cash flow. Manager sell decisions create yet another set of liquidity events. Finally, if
income flows, natural asset turnover and manager sales create insufficient liquidity to meet
spending requirements, investors retain the ability to direct sales of assets to provide for current
consumption. The modest transactions costs incurred in selling assets pale in comparison to
the drag on returns created by holding cash as a standard part of an institutional portfolio.
Based on delivery of poor real returns and failure to serve as a riskless asset for long-term
investors, cash plays no significant role in a well-constructed endowment portfolio.
Market Characteristics
At December 31, 2006, U.S. government bonds totaled $3.2 trillion, of which $2.2 trillion
represented full-faith-and-credit obligations of the U.S. Treasury and $1.0 trillion represented
debt of government sponsored enterprises. U.S. Treasury bonds trade in the deepest, most
efficient market in the world.
The universe of Treasury bonds sported a yield to maturityVI of 4.9 percent at year-end
2006 with an average maturity of 6.9 years and a duration of 5.0 years. Agency issues promised
a yield of 5.1 percent with a 5.1-year average maturity and 3.5-year duration.
Summary
U.S. Treasury bonds provide a unique form of portfolio diversification, serving as a hedge
against financial accidents and unanticipated deflation. No other asset type comes close to
matching the diversifying power created by long-term, noncallable, default-free, full-faith-and-
credit obligations of the U.S. government.
Investors pay a price for the diversifying power of Treasury bonds. The ironclad security of
Treasury debt causes investors to expect (and deserve) low returns relative to those expected
from riskier assets. While holders of long-term Treasury bonds stand to benefit from declining
price inflation, in an environment of unanticipated inflation Treasury bondholders lose.
Treasury bonds' modest expected returns and adverse reaction to inflation argue for modest
allocations to the asset class by long-term investors.
FOREIGN DEVELOPED EQUITY
Investments in developed economy equity markets provide the same expected returns as U.S.
equity investments. But overseas investments exhibit two critical differentiating characteristics
relative to domestic holdings. First, markets in different regions respond to different economic
forces, causing returns to behave differently from one region of the world to the next. Second,
investment in non-U.S. markets exposes investors to foreign currency fluctuations, adding
another variable to the investment equation.
Developed economy equity markets share similar levels of expected return. Comparability
in economic infrastructure, commonality in drivers of economic performance, and secular
liberalization in flows of labor, goods, and services across national boundaries combine to cause
investors to expect similar long-run results from investments in developed equity markets.
Although investor enthusiasm for individual countries waxes and wanes along with strong or
weak recent market performance, over reasonably long periods of time, investors might expect
the developed markets in North America, Europe, and Asia to produce roughly comparable
returns.
In fact, in the thirty-seven years since the 1970 inception of the Morgan Stanley Capital
International (MSCI) Europe, Australasia and Far East (EAFE) Index that tracks non-U.S.
equity market performance, EAFE countries generated 10.8 percent per annum returns relative
to 11.2 percent per annum returns for the U.S. dominated S&P 500 Index. While the domestic
and international results fall in the same neighborhood, the United States enjoys a slight
margin of superiority. Because such market performance comparisons exhibit a high degree of
sensitivity to beginning and ending dates, the most reasonable conclusion supports the
assumption of approximate equivalence between expected returns for domestic and
international equitics.
Diversifying Power
The lack of correlation between foreign markets and the U.S. market provides valuable
diversification to investors. Some observers speculate that the process of global economic
integration has caused individual country equity markets to behave increasingly one like the
other, leading to less prospective diversification. As evidence of increasing correlation between
markets, diversification skeptics point to the behavior of equity markets in the crash of 1987
and in the financial dislocations during the crisis of 1998. In both instances, stock markets
worldwide exhibited similar, extraordinary declines. Yet, market declines in 1987 and 1998
constituted short-term events in which market players expressed extreme preferences for
liquidity and quality. After brief periods during which many developed equity markets moved
in concert, individual country markets reverted to fluctuation in response to country-specific
drivers of local market performance.
Consider the relative returns of equity markets in the United States and Japan. In the 1980s,
Japan dominated all other world stock markets, returning 28.4 percent per annum versus 16.5
percent per annum for other non-U.S. markets and 17.4 percent per annum for the U.S. equity
markets. Near the end of the extraordinary bull run in Japanese stocks, Japan boasted the
largest market capitalization in the world, surpassing even the massive U.S. market in size.
In the 1990s, Japan's fortunes reversed. During the last decade of the twentieth century,
Japan's economy collapsed, contributing to a market decline of 0.9 percent per annum for the
decade. In contrast, other non-U.S. markets returned 13.5 percent per annum and the United
States market produced an astonishing 18.2 percent return per annum. As Japan's stock
market declined, the country lost its dominant equity market position, falling so far behind the
United States that at one point Japan's cquity market capitalization amounted to less than one-
fifth of the U.S.'s market capitalization. Clearly, investments in individual equity markets
behave differently, generating returns that differ one from the other, thereby providing
diversification to portfolio holdings.
Foreign Currency Exposure
Investors in foreign equities assume foreign exchange risk as an unavoidable part of overseas
equity exposure. Realistic investors expect foreign currency translation neither to add to nor to
subtract from investment results. Even though much ink spills and many trees fall in the service
of market prognosticators who fill reams of pages in attempts to divine the future of foreign
exchange rates, no one really knows where currencies will go. Sensible investors avoid
speculating on currencies.
Some observers suggest that holders of foreign cquities should routinely hedge foreign
exchange exposure. Unfortunately, hedges prove difficult to fashion as foreign equity managers
face uncertain holding periods and unknowable future position sizes, creating issues regarding
the appropriate term and magnitude of the hedge. As a result, foreign equity investors
necessarily assume at least some foreign exchange risk along with commitments to the asset
class.
Fortunately, finance theorists conclude that some measure of foreign exchange exposure
adds to portfolio diversification. Unless foreign currency positions constitute more than 20
percent or 25 percent of portfolio assets, currency exposure serves to reduce overall portfolio
risk. Beyond 20 percent to 25 percent of portfolio assets, the currency exposure constitutes a
source of incremental risk, suggesting consideration of some corrective action.
Performance Chasing
Investors tend to seek diversification when the core portfolio asset disappoints, either in
absolute or in relative terms. For instance, from 1998 to 2003, a period during which foreign
markets underperformed, returning a cumulative -18.5 percent relative to a cumulative -6.4
percent for the broad U.S. market, college endowments maintained a relatively stable allocation
to non-U.S. equities. The fact that foreign stock allocations fell in a narrow range of between
12.5 percent and 13.8 percent for the period indicates that investors were engaged in rational
rebalancing activity. In contrast to the rational rebalancing in the face of poor relative
performance, as foreign markets took off in 2004, allocations to foreign equitics took off, too.
In the three years from 2004 to 2006, non-U.S. equitics posted returns of 23.9 percent per
annum and emerging markets generated returns of 35.8 percent per annum, completely
dominating the U.S. market returns of 13.1 percent per annum. In response, college
endowment managers chased performance, boosting foreign equity allocations from 13.8
percent in 2003 to 15.6 percent in 2004 to 17.4 percent in 2005 and finally to 20.1 percent in
2006. Momentum strategies generally end badly.
Strong relative performance of foreign equities caused endowment managers to
dramatically increase non-U.S. equity holdings, with investors frequently citing diversification
as the rationale for boosting foreign allocations. Disappointing performance from the
diversifying asset may cause investors to reduce allocations at an inopportune time. Sensible
investors pursue diversification as a policy to reduce risk, not as a tactic to chase performance.
By following a disciplined policy of maintaining a well-diversified set of portfolio exposures,
regardless of market zigs and zags, investors establish the conditions for long-run success. In
fact, when taking market conditions into account, investors increase the odds of success by
diversifying into asset classes after they suffer poor performance. In any case, foreign equitics
provide an important tool for reducing portfolio risk without sacrificing expected returns.
Foreign Equity Prices and Inflation
Investors in domestic equities face an inflationary paradox-stocks appear to provide good
long-term protection against inflation, while they seem to offer poor short-term protection.
Foreign stock investors encounter no such conundrum. The tenuous link between (2)
domestic inflation and (b) the returns of foreign stocks translated into dollars proves so remote
as to render foreign equities useless as a hedge against inflation.
Alignment of Interests
As a first approximation, alignment of interests between U.S. investors and foreign
corporations resembles the relationship between U.S. investors and U.S. corporations.
Generally speaking, both domestically and overseas, equity investors expect corporate
management to look after shareholder interests.
Even though the corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom, among others, highlighted
the shortcomings of American corporate governance, the fact remains that in the United States
a strong coincidence of interest exists between shareholders and management. As a broad
generalization, elsewhere in the world corporate managements focus less single-mindedly on
profit generation. In some countries, cultural norms lead to greater concern for the needs of
other stakeholders, including workers, lenders, and the broader community. In other countries,
poor governance structures allow controlling shareholders to divert resources from minority
shareholders. While a lesser coincidence of interests between overseas managements and their
shareholders constitutes a disadvantage to owners of foreign shares, the advantages of
increasing the investment opportunity set argue for inclusion of nonU.S. securities in
individual investor portfolios.
Market Characteristics
At December 31, 2006, developed foreign markets totaled $23.8 trillion, as measured by
Morgan Stanley Capital International. The sum of the twenty-two countries included by
MSCI in the non-U.S. developed world exceeded the market capitalization of the U.S. market,
which stood at $18.2 trillion as of year-end 2006. Japan led the non-U.S. world with $5.0
trillion in assets. Other large markets include the United Kingdom ($3.8 trillion), France ($2.4
trillion), Canada ($1.8 trillion), and Germany ($1.6 trillion). Europe accounted for 63 percent
of the non-U.S. world, Asia for 26 percent, Canada for 7 percent and Australia/New Zealand
for 5 percent.
Overall, foreign developed equity markets sported a dividend yield of 2.4 percent, a price-
carnings ratio of 16.0, and a price-book ratio of 27. Regional variations matter. Europe yielded
27 percent at year-end 2006 relative to 1.1 percent for Japan, while European securities posted
a price-earnings ratio of 14.5 and a price-book ratio of 2.6 relative to respective ratios of 21.2
and 2.1 for Japan.
Summary
Since expected returns from foreign developed markets roughly approximate expected returns
from U.S. markets, investors establish positions in foreign developed equity markets primarily
to provide portfolio diversification. The most important source of diversification stems from
the fact that forces driving returns in equity markets outside of the United States differ from
forces driving returns in the United States. Foreign currency exposure adds a further measure
of diversification to investor portfolios.
Sensible investors invest in foreign equity markets through thick and thin, regardless of
recent past performance. All too often, market players seek the diversification promised by
foreign stocks following a period of strong relative foreign market returns. When the
diversifying strategies fail to produce returns superior to domestic market results, investors
abandon the disappointing diversifying assets. Performance-chasing players use international
equities to whipsaw portfolios, locking in poor relative returns and damaging investment
results.
EMERGING MARKETS EQUITY
Emerging markets represent a high-risk, high-expected-return segment of the marketable
equities universe. Defined as a group of countries with economies in an intermediate stage of
development, neither undeveloped nor developed, emerging markets present a formidable
array of fundamental risks for investors. On a macro level, investors concern themselves with
the development of the overall economy and the maturation of the securities markets
infrastructure. On a micro level, investors worry about quality of management and profit
orientation of nascent enterprises.
Market observers frequently confuse strong economic growth with strong equity market
prospects. Consider the extreme case of a command economy with resource allocation rules
that operate without the benefit of securities markets. Clearly, economic growth occurs
without any impact on stock prices, as equity securities do not exist. In the less extreme case of
market-oriented economies with poor resource allocation, providers of equity capital might
receive consistently poor returns. Corporate revenues may accrue disproportionately to
corporate management (through salaries), to labor (through wages), or to government entities
(through taxes), leaving inadequate recompense for capital. In well-functioning economics,
prices and returns adjust to reflect financial market conditions. Not all emerging market
economics function well. Profitable equity market investments require profitable enterprises,
for investors ultimately share in corporate earnings. Therein lies the primary microeconomic
risk for emerging market investors. In emerging markets, as elsewhere, economic growth may
not lead to corporate profitabil which in turn translates i stock market success.
Economic history contains many examples of emerging markets that submerged. In an
article dramatically entitled "Survival," Stephen Brown, William Goetzmann, and Stephen
Ross identify thirty-six stock exchanges operating at the beginning of the twentieth century. Of
the thirty-six, "more than half suffered at least one major hiatus in trading... usually due to
nationalizations or war." More distressingly to investors who believe in the inevitability of
progress, of the thirty-six markets that operated in 1900, fully fifteen remained classified as
emerging markets more than 100 years later. One market, located in Serbia's Belgrade, fails
even to make the twenty-first century list of emerging markets. The authors dryly note that "in
fact, the very term 'emerging markets' admits the possibility that these markets might fail."17
In recent years, investors enjoyed the opportunity to invest in an ever-expanding set of
developing markets. Morgan Stanley Capital International, the leading constructor of non-
U.S. market indices, began tracking emerging markets in 1988 with an index of eight countries
ranging from Mexico to Jordan to Thailand. Five years later, the population stood at nineteen
with notable additions of India, Korca, and Portugal. By 1998, the total reached twenty-eight
as South Africa, Russia, and a number of central European countries joined MSCI's coverage
universe. In 2001, Egypt and Morocco joined the index, while Sri Lanka departed. Because of
investment restrictions and lack of liquidity, Venezuela left the index in 2006, bringing the
emerging market country population to twenty-five.
On occasion, countries move out of the emerging world to the developed world. In 1997
Portugal made the leap, and in 2001 Greece followed. As emerging economies make progress,
more countries will advance to the ranks of the developed world.
The Bull Case for Emerging Markets
Antoine van Agtmael, longtime investor in emerging markets, articulates a bullish perspective
on emerging markets in his excellent book, The Emerging Markets Century.
As we enter the Emerging Markets Century, the time has come to rethink what we mean
by "risk." Gazing back in the rearview mirror, we once regarded emerging markets as
crisis-prone, volatile, desperately poor, small in the global economy to the point of
irrelevancy, dependent on Western consumer markets, and heavily protected. Stock
markets were poorly regulated and prone to manipulation; a lack of participation by
institutional investors and pension funds left much room for speculation and insider
trading; corporate disclosure was notoriously poor.
More developed markets, in contrast, led in economic stability, technology, market
size, and transparency. A better legal framework and corporate governance protected
investors while domestic pension funds and a large mutual funds industry were ready
buyers of stocks and bonds. And, of course, a huge gap remained in the size,
sophistication, and quality of companies between the West and "the Rest."
lay, the case for emerging market investing is different precisely because (1) these
markets themselves are less different and more global than before and (2) a growing
number of companies are becoming world-class. While emerging markets were until
fairly recently regarded as a small yet risky niche, the increasing importance of these
countries and the importance of these companies has propelled emerging markets from
being the spice of an investment portfolio to a more central role that is more mainstream
and less of a gamble. The practical implications of this broad-based shift both in real and
perceived risk are that emerging markets should be a core component of investors
portfolios rather than an afterthought but that they will also be less exciting going
forward, 18
While Antoine van Agtmacl's work supports the role of emerging markets equities as a core
asset class, their relatively immature regulatory environments argue for special care on the part
of investment managers. Emerging markets may be "less exciting going forward," but they will
continue to be exciting.
Emerging Market Equity Prices and Inflation
The link between inflation in the United States and emerging market stock returns suffers from
the same issues as the link between U.S. inflation and foreign developed stock returns. That
said, basic commodities play an important role in a number of emerging markets economies.
To the extent that the U.S. suffers commodity-price-induced inflationary pressures,
investments in emerging markets stocks may provide partial protection against the inflation.
Alignment of Interests
Development of market infrastructure in emerging economics proceeds in fits and starts as
legislators, regulators, and corporate managements learn the rules of the game. Investors
accustomed to the protections afforded in the United States find most emerging markets quite
inhospitable. Quality of securities legislation ranges from poor to good, enforcement of
regulations varies from inadequate to adequate, and fidelity of managements to shareholders'
interests falls all over the lot. Caveat emptor.
Government policies sometimes interfere with investor interests, occasionally in dramatic
fashion. In 1998, during the Asian crisis, Malaysia restricted the convertibility of the ringgit,
effectively prohibiting foreign investors from repatriating funds. Because of bad behavior
regarding capital controls, MSCI removed Malaysia from one of the firm's emerging market
indices. Not until Malaysia removed capital controls in late 1999 did the country reestablish its
credentials as a full-fledged member of the MSCI roster.
In emerging markets, corporate actions resemble, at times, the Wild West. One market
observer suggested that Russian equity investors put money in enterprises where management
attempts grand theft and avoid commitments to companies where management engages in
petty larceny. The rationale for the superficially contradictory advice lay in the notion that
managements of truly valuable enterprises attempted to steal the entire entity, while
managements of less valuable enterprises simply sought to pilfer small pieces.
The inferior alignment of interests facing investors in emerging markets represents one of
the critical risk factors that cause investors to demand higher rates of return for emerging
markets equity investments. Since investors operate in an environment with less-evolved
frameworks for the definition and resolution of legal and regulatory issues, the resulting
uncertainty forces sensible investors to seek premium returns.
Emerging markets governments occasionally drive wedges between the interests of
shareholders and managements. Controls on the ownership and voting rights of local shares
sometimes lead to the creation of two classes of share owners, with attendant problems for the
second-class foreign investor. Capital controls, although infrequently imposed, interfere with
the ability of foreign investors to transfer funds freely. Government regulation in the emerging
markets contains the potential to harm foreign investor interests.
In other instances, corporate managements fail to act in shareholder interests. A particularly
prevalent problem in many Asian countries involves family-controlled companies satisfying
family desires at the expense of external minority shareholder wishes. An absence of
transparency compounds the problem as outside investors often lack the information required
to identify and address insider-dealing issues.
As emerging markets mature and as global capital markets liberalize, structural problems
with misalignment of interests become less severe. Nonetheless, rational investors require a
substantial return premium to expose assets to companies that operate in the less-than-ideal
emerging markets legal and regulatory framework.
Market Characteristics
At December 31, 2006, emerging markets equities totaled $7.2 trillion according to MSCI.
Ranging from India ($824 billion) and China ($816 billion), which by market-capitalization
would rank in the middle of the developed market cohort, to the much smaller markets of Peru
($38 billion) and Jordan ($30 billion), the emerging markets universe encompasses a broad
range of countries. Asia accounts for 53 percent of emerging market equity assets, Latin
America for 20 percent, Europe for 16 percent, and Africa and the Middle East for 12 percent.
Emerging market valuations trumped those of the United States at year-end 2006 (at least
for investors seeking valuc). The emerging markets dividend yield amounted to 2.1 percent
relative to 1.7 percent for the United States. The price-earnings ratio stood at 15.6,
representing a substantial discount to the U.S. market level of 19.5. Emerging markets traded
at a price-book ratio of 2.5, identical to the U.S. level.
Summary
Investors in emerging markets equities require substantial expected returns to compensate for
the high level of fundamental investment risk. During the period for which good data exist,
investors received inadequate compensation for risks incurred. From 1985, when the World
Bank's International Finance Corporation began measuring emerging markets equity returns,
to December 2006, emerging markets equities produced 12.0 percent per annum returns (as
measured by the IFC Global Composite) relative to 13.1 percent for the S&P 500 and 12.4
percent for EAFE. The deficit relative to developed market returns indicates that emerging
market investors accepted higher fundamental risks than developed market investors without
earning excess returns. Investors in emerging markets hope the future treats them better than
the past.
Because of macroeconomic and microeconomic concerns, emerging markets equities
promise high expected returns with commensurately high levels of risk. An allocation to
emerging markets stocks contains the potential to enhance the risk and return characteristics of
well-structured investment portfolios.
CONCLUSION
Investors find a number of essential components of a well-diversified, equity-oriented portfolio
in the traditional asset classes of domestic equity, U.S. Treasury bonds, foreign developed
market equity, and foreign emerging market equity. Domestic and foreign equities drive
portfolio returns, while Treasury bonds provide diversifying power. By employing traditional
asset classes in a well-diversified portfolio, investors build a strong foundation for investment
success.
In the course of providing basic, valuable, differentiable characteristics to investor
portfolios, traditional asset classes rely on market-generated returns. By investing in asset classes
in which market forces drive returns, investors achieve a high level of confidence that the
various asset classes will produce the expected long-term results, dramatically reducing the risk
of active-management slippage between hoped-for asset class performance and actual
outcomes.
Traditional asset classes trade in broad, deep, investable markets, ensuring substantial levels
of commitment by a range of Wall Street firms. The resulting competition leads to market
transparency and efficiency, increasing the likelihood that investors transact on fair terms.
Investors without active management expertise rely primarily on traditional asset classes for
portfolio construction, perhaps, adding exposure to Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities
and an index of real estate investment trusts to round out the portfolio. Investors with active
management expertise not only enjoy the possibility of producing market-beating returns for
domestic and foreign equitics, but also benefit from the inclusion of asset classes that depend
on active management, including absolute return, real assets, and private equity.

Alternative Asset Classes
Alternative asset classes-absolute return, real assets, and private equity-contribute to the
portfolio construction process by pushing back the efficient frontier, allowing creation of
portfolios with higher returns for a given level of risk or with lower risk for a given level of
return. Investors who employ alternative assets as legitimate tools in the portfolio allocation
process reduce dependence on traditional marketable securities, facilitating the structuring of
truly diversified portfolios.
As separate asset classes, each alternative investment category adds something distinctive
and important to portfolio characteristics. Absolute return and real assets provide
diversification, generating returns driven by factors materially different from those determining
results of other asset classes. In contrast, private equity returns depend on many factors
common to the determination of marketable equity returns. Although private investments
provide little diversification, well-selected private holdings contain the potential to make a
dramatic contribution to portfolio returns.
Prices for many alternative assets lack the efficiency typical of prices for traditional
marketable securities, leading to opportunities for astute managers to add substantial value in
the investment process. In fact, investors in alternative asset classes must pursue active
management since market returns do not exist in the sense of an investable passive option. Even
if investors could purchase the median result in an alternative asset class, the results would
likely disappoint. Longer term median historical returns have lagged comparable marketable
security results, both in absolute and risk-adjusted terms. Only by generating superior active
returns do investors realize the promise of investing in alternative assets.
ABSOLUTE RETURN
Absolute return investing consists of inefficiency-exploiting marketable securities positions
that exhibit little or no correlation to traditional stock and bond investments. Well-structured
absolute return portfolios provide equity-like returns with powerful diversifying
characteristics.
situations
Absolute return managers reduce market risk by investing in event-driven or value-driven
cted to behave independently of market forces. Event-driven positions depend
on the completion of a specific corporate finance transaction such as the consummation of a
merger or the emergence of a company from bankruptcy. Value-driven strategies employ
hedged portfolios in which short positions offset long positions, dramatically reducing the
investor's systematic risk. Absolute return managers seek to generate high levels of returns,
independent of market results, in contrast to the relative benchmark-beating returns sought by
active marketable security managers.
The short duration of absolute return strategies makes the short-term cost of funds a fair
starting point for evaluating manager performance. The basic math of hedged positions implies
that (in the absence of skill and fees) investors deserve a money market rate of return.! If
managers add value, returns will exceed short-term rates. If managers fail to add value, returns
will fall short of money market rates.
Without active management, absolute return does not exist. The fundamental notion of
absolute return investing rests on identification and successful exploitation of inefficiencies in
pricing marketable securities. In the absence of value added by active managers, investors
receive money market rates of return, appropriate compensation for creating positions without
material market exposure.
Event-driven Investing
Event-driven opportunities exist because of the complexities inherent in business combinations
and corporate reorganizations. Mainstream portfolio managers recognize that the determinants
of the merger endgame and the bankruptcy resolution differ materially from the factors that
predominate in day-to-day security valuation. The legal and regulatory environment changes
upon announcement of a proposed combination or reorganization, giving the informed
specialist an advantage over the competent generalist. Superior analytical skills create a
meaningful edge for active event-driven investors.
The opportunity exploited by event-driven investors stems in part from sales of securities by
investors unwilling to commit the resources to develop a thorough understanding of the
circumstances surrounding complex corporate finance transactions. In the case of distressed
securities, selling pressure comes from investors unable or unwilling to hold securities of failing
or failed companies. The sometimes massive supply of securities from holders uncomfortable
with positions in companies undergoing basic structural change allows event-driven investors
to establish positions with attractive embedded returns.
Merger arbitrage represents a typical event-driven absolute return strategy, with results
related to the manager's ability to predict the probability that a deal will close, the likely timing
and the expected consideration for the transaction. Upon announcement of a stock-for-stock
deal, the price of the target company's stock generally rises to a level somewhat below the
acquirer's offer, creating an opportunity for the merger arbitrageur to profit. Uncertainty
regarding the ultimate outcome of the transaction causes many holders to sell, motivated by
the concern that gains stimulated by the merger offer might disappear for any of a number of
reasons. After careful assessment of deal-specific factors, merger arbitrage investors buy the
stock of the target company and sell shares of the acquiring company, hoping to profit from the
elimination of the spread when the transaction closes. Because the arbitrageur holds long
positions offset by short positions, the direction of the overall market plays little role in
determining the position's returns. Instead, results depend on the merger arbitrageur's ability
to assess correctly the factors relevant to the ultimate conclusion of the transaction.
Newell Rubbermaid Merger Arbitrage
The March 1999 combination of Newell and Rubbermaid illustrates some of the market
dynamics underpinning event-driven investment opportunities. After the October 1998
announcement of the proposed merger, Rubbermaid shares responded by rising nearly 25
percent as shown in Figure 8.1. Trading volumes increased more than ten-fold, from an average
of 566,000 shares per day in the week prior to the announcement to 5,960,000 shares per day
in the week following. Taking advantage of the merger induced price rise, traditional long-only
investors exited the stock and created an opportunity for merger arbitrageurs to establish
positions.
The terms of the definitive agreement called for a tax-free exchange of shares in which
holders of Rubbermaid would receive 0.7883 shares of Newell upon closing, expected in early
1999. By buying a share of Rubbermaid at the post announcement price of $31.81 and selling
0.7883 of a share of Newell at $43.25, arbitrageurs generated net proceeds of $2.28 per share. If
the companies were to complete the transaction on the originally proposed terms, arbitrageurs
would have equivalent valuc positions at the closing. Upon consummation of the deal, merger
arbitrageurs would close out positions by delivering Newell shares received from the
Rubbermaid exchange to cover the original Newell short sale.

Merger Between Newell and Rubbermaid October 12, 1998-March 15, 1999
11e
Back-of-the-envelope calculations illustrate the return characteristics of the transaction.
When the deal closed on March 24, 1999, merger arbitrageurs earned the $2.28 post
announcement spread between the two stocks and a short rebate of about $0.57 for a total of
approximately $2.85. Cash flow yield played essentially no role in the return calculation since
the dividends earned on the Rubbermaid shares offset the dividends paid on the Newell shares.
Based on an initial capital commitment of $31.81 per share, the position delivered a gross
return of about 9 percent over a five month period, equivalent to an annualized return in the
low 20 percent range.1
The Newell Rubbermaid combination proceeded without a hitch, as the spread between
Rubbermaid and Newell shares narrowed week-by-weck until the scheduled closing. Not all
merger arbitrage transactions proceed as smoothly. The September 1998 combination of
World Com and MCI Communications began in November 1996 as a proposal by British
Telecommunications plc to acquire MCI in the largest cross border transaction ever. Between
the initiation of merger discussions and the ultimate resolution, merger arbitrageurs wrestled
with a laundry list of problems, including antitrust concerns, regulatory approvals, changes in
company business strategy, corporate operating difficulties, international political issues, and
competition from competing bidders." Regardless of whether deals take a simple path from
inception to resolution or follow a convoluted route, the returns to merger arbitrage investors
depend far more on the specific event than on the general direction of the market.
...
In the distressed securities area, event-driven investors look for opportunity in securities of
companies undergoing reorganization. Because of the complexity of the issues surrounding
bankruptcy, many market participants sell positions regardless of price, creating an
opportunity for hard working investors to profit. By assessing the timing of the company's
emergence from bankruptcy and valuing the expected package of securities, players in the
distressed securities arena generate returns more dependent on events important to the
bankruptcy process than on the level of the overall stock market.
Event-driven strategies lack the power to insulate investors completely from financial
market moves. In the case of merger arbitrage, factors influencing the stock market or the
financing market may alter the likelihood either that a particular merger will be completed or
that mergers in general will move forward, causing a commonality of influence. In the case of
distressed investing, to the extent that investors receive equity interests as part of a package of
securities distributed upon a company's reorganization, the market exerts direct influence on
the ultimate return to a distressed securities investment. In spite of identifiable links between
event-driven investing and market moves, under a wide range of circumstances event-driven
strategies provide meaningful portfolio diversification.
In times of financial crisis, the correlation between event-driven strategies and market
activity increases to uncomfortable levels. During the stock market crash in October 1987,
merger arbitrage positions fell in step with the general market, providing little protection in the
short run against the dramatic market decline. As time passed, investors recognized that
companies continued to meet contractual obligations, ultimately completing all merger deals
previously announced. The return of confidence improved merger arbitrage results, providing
handsome returns relative to the market.
Results of two prominent merger arbitrage firms, which later formed the base for Yale's
absolute return portfolio, illustrate the importance of evaluating performance over reasonable
time horizons. Pursuing the conservative approach of investing only in announced deals, the
two firms reported combined results of -17.9 percent for the fourth quarter of 1987, somewhat
ahead of the S&P 500 return of -22.5 percent but well behind expectations for event-driven
strategies. Even though no merger deals "broke," the market turmoil caused investors to
demand higher compensation for merger arbitrage risk, resulting in a dramatic widening of
spreads. In the first quarter of 1988 the arbitrage managers rebounded, posting results of 16.3
percent, far ahead of the S&P 500 returns of 5.7 percent. Viewed in isolation, the last quarter
of 1987 provided disappointing double digit losses coincident with the stock market crash,
failing to protect the portfolio during the period of crisis. Viewed as a package, the fourth
quarter of 1987 with the worst results ever for both firms and the first quarter of 1988 with the
best results ever for both firms, essentially preserved assets and provided meaningful
diversification relative to the equity market's losses.
Not all periods of financial trauma end as happily as the aftermath of the crash of October
1987. In August 2007, an extraordinary credit crisis called into question the viability of an
estimated $400 billion of merger-related financing. As a result, prospective returns on the First
Data and TXU merger arbitrage deals skyrocketed from low double digit levels in June 2007 to
more than 70 percent in mid-August 2007. Both First Data and TXU closed, providing
handsome returns to intrepid investors who made late summer bets on the deals. In contrast to
the 1987 experience, however, a number of 2007 vintage deals failed to close. The link,
however unusual, between markets and merger deals lessens the diversifying power of merger
arbitrage. That said, even though diversifying financial assets, including absolute return
strategies, may show high correlation to marketable securities for short time periods, over
reasonable investment horizons assets driven by fundamentally different factors produce
fundamentally different patterns of returns.
Because event-driven investors strive to hit singles and doubles, creating a broadly diversified
portfolio makes sense. In an environment without huge potential winners to offset inevitable
costly mistakes, careful investors limit the costs that any one position might impose on the
portfolio.
Event-driven portfolios benefit from engaging managers with a broad set of investment
tools. Hiring a specialist focused only on one aspect of the business, say merger arbitrage, forces
investors to ride a return rollercoaster. When opportunities abound, investors reap attractive
returns from the niche strategy. If high returns attract capital to the activity, or if the supply of
investment opportunities wanes, specialized investors continue to commit funds to their sole
area of expertise, ultimately reaping poor returns from funds invested at inopportune times.
In contrast, if a manager develops expertise in more than one event-driven strategy, when
returns appear sparse in one segment funds flow natura more attractive segments. The
ability to target areas of relative opportunity dampens the inevitable fluctuations experienced
by focused funds and creates the possibility of structuring higher return, lower risk portfolios.
Value-Driven Investing
Value-driven absolute return strategies rest on the manager's ability to identify undervalued
and overvalued securities, establish positions, and reduce market exposure through hedging
activity. If an investor purchases a portfolio of attractively priced stocks and sells short an
equivalent amount of expensively priced stocks, the offsetting long and short positions
eliminate systematic exposure to the equity market. Results depend entirely on stock-picking
ability, with the long/short investor enjoying the opportunity to add value with both long ideas
and short ideas. Skillful value-driven managers win on both sides of the portfolio.
While value-driven and event-driven strategies share a lack of correlation with traditional
marketable securities, value-driven portfolios require a longer time horizon than do event-
driven portfolios. Expected holding periods for merger arbitrage and distressed securities
correspond to the anticipated date of corporate combination or bankruptcy resolution,
implying a reasonably short duration for event-driven strategies. In contrast, value-driven
positions lack the clear triggers present in event-driven investing. To the consternation of fund
managers, undervalued stocks frequently decline, while overvalued positions often risc, leading
to poor near-term performance relative to expectations. Even without adverse price moves in
the short run, mispricings identified by long/short investors may take years to resolve.
Value-driven managers share much in common with active managers of traditional
marketable securities. On the long side, concentrated portfolios of thoroughly researched
securities provide the underpinnings for investment success. On the short side, the same
bottom-up techniques of fundamental analysis used to evaluate long positions provide the
basis for identifying overvalued securities. Adding the flexibility to exploit overvalued positions
-through short sales-doubles the opportunity for a manager to add value. While short
selling shares a common foundation with long investing, a successful short portfolio represents
more than a richly priced inverse of a long portfolio.
Short Selling Challenges
Management of the short side of the portfolio poses several challenges peculiar to selling
securities short. First, investors frequently underestimate the resilience of corporate
management. Even when the facts and figures indicate that a company deserves classification as
one of the "living dead," managers frequently find a way to escape the seemingly inevitable
consequences of their circumstances. Second, the portfolio management implications of
adverse price movements require greater diversification of short positions. If a stock moves
against a short seller by increasing in price, the position increases in size. To take advantage of
the now more attractively priced short opportunity the investor faces the uncomfortable
prospect of further increasing the position. Starting with a modest allocation to a particular
short idea allows an increase in position size without creating an uncomfortable concentration
in a single stock. Contrast the dynamics of a losing short position with the behavior of a losing
long position. As the long's price declines it becomes a smaller portion of the portfolio,
reducing its impact on returns and facilitating new purchases at the newly discounted,
relatively more attractive price. The simple math of price behavior argues for running
reasonably diversified portfolios of short positions. Short sellers face challenges from success, as
well as from failure. When the stock price of a fundamentally troubled company crashes, the
short seller benefits, but the size of the short position declines dramatically, requiring
identification of attractive replacement candidates. While long managers often run with
successful investments for years, short managers hope to operate on a treadmill, with frequent
turnover of holdings caused by the exit of winning positions from the portfolio. The price
dynamics of short selling cause successful short managers to follow and hold a large number of
securities.
Aside from a peculiar set of investment challenges, short sellers face some unusual technical
problems in managing portfolio positions. To execute trades, short sellers borrow securities to
deliver to the buyer on the other side of the transaction. (Buyers purchasing shares, whether
from a short seller or a natural seller, expect to receive securities on the trade's settlement date.)
As long as short sellers maintain the borrow, the position remains intact. If the short seller loses
the borrow because the security lender recalls the security, the short seller must replace the
borrow or lose the position. When the market for borrowing a particular security becomes
tight, short sellers face a short squeeze. Security borrowers tend to have most trouble with
small, less liquid companies, exactly the type of security likely to present interesting short
opportunities.
The unusual set of problems confronting short sellers places an effective limit on portfolio
size, forcing managers to constrain the level of assets under management. A reasonable
portfolio size constitutes a necessary precondition for the potential to add value, as excessive
levels of assets amount to a nearly insurmountable barrier to success. Even though the
aggressive assumption that value-driven managers might outperform the market by as much as
several percentage points cach on the long and short sides seems to fly in the face of traditional
active manager experience, limits on portfolio size provide hope for significant outperformance
by long/short managers.
Return Expectations
Hedge fund managers who attempt to produce truly independent returns generally articulate
reasonably modest goals. Consider a fund manager with a portfolio consisting of equal
measures of long positions and short positions. From a market perspective, the longs offset the
shorts. In a rising market, losses from the shorts offset gains from the longs. In a falling market,
losses from the longs offset gains from the shorts. Balanced long/short investing takes the
market out of the equation.
Security selection represents the primary source of return for disciplined long/short
investors. To the extent that managers identify undervalued long positions and overvalued
short positions, the portfolio stands to benefit from twice the security selection power available
to long-only managers.
A secondary source of returns for long/short managers comes from the rebate earned from
establishing short positions. Short sales generate cash proceeds that carn close to a money-
market rate of interest. While the short rebate adds to the return of the long/short investor, a
short rebate proves insufficient in and of itself to justify pursuing a long/short investment
strategy. If an investor wishes to earn a money-market return, buying a money-market fund
provides a more direct, less costly, and less risky route to generating cash returns.
Suppose long/short fund managers exhibit security selection skill consistent with top-
quartile, long-only domestic equity managers. For the ten years ending December 31, 2006,
one widely used universe of active managers showed top quartile returns of 2.6 percent per
annum above the market. If a long/short manager produces top quartile results on each of
the long and short sides of the portfolio, security selection generates a return of 5.2 percent.
The expected magnitude of gains available from astute security selection falls far short of
double digits.
Adding a short-term interest rate (reflecting the short rebate) to the value added from
security selection produces the gross return for long/short investing. Over the ten years ending
December 31, 2006, short-term interest rates averaged 3.7 percent per annum. Combining the
top-quartile security selection return of 5.2 percent with the money-market return yields a
total return of 8.9 percent, before fees.
Fees create a substantial burden for hedge fund investors. A management fee of one percent
and a profits interest of 20 percent combine to subtract 2.6 percent from the gross return,
leaving a net return of 6.3 percent for the investor.IV Even with substantial active management
success (as defined by two top-quartile results), net returns to long/short hedge fund investors
show only a modest increment over money-market rates.
In cases where long/short managers exhibit mediocre stock picking skill, results disappoint.
Consider the results of the median equity manager. For the ten years ending December 31,
2006, the median active domestic equity manager produced gross returns of 1.1 percent per
annum above the market return. Doubling the median active management return produces a
2.2 percent return for security selection. Incorporating the cash return of 3.7 percent generates
a gross return of 5.9 percent. The fee burden shaves the net return to 3.9 percent, a result
disturbingly close to the 3.7 percent return of simply holding cash!
Finally, contemplate the poor position of an underperforming manager. Over the ten years
ending December 31, 2006, third-quartile managers underperformed the market by 0.1
percent before fees. With an active management deficit, long/short investors earned 3.5
percent, which falls short of the return for holding cash. Fees take the gross return to a 2.0
percent net result, bringing the misery of below-cash returns to investors suffering the
consequences of poor active management.
Even though average and below-average investment results sting investors, the investment
manager makes out nicely in all cases. Regardless of performance, the manager collects a one
percent fee, representing more-or-less standard compensation for traditional long-only money
management. Adding the profits interest allows the skillful top-quartile manager to earn 2.6
percent, a hefty load on a single-digit return. Total fees for median stock pickers amount to 2.0
percent. Even in instances where net returns to investors fail to reach the returns available on
cash, the manager profits handsomely. Fees for third-quartile performers total 1.5 percent,
adding the insult of excessive fees to the injury of poor performance.
The example of balanced long/short cquity management provides a powerful illustration of
the central role that active management plays in absolute return investing. In the absence of
superior active results, investors face certain disappointment. Long/short equity managers
must consistently produce better than top-quartile returns to justify the fee structure accepted
by hedge fund investors. Investors unable to identify the best of the best should pursue passive
investment strategies.
Yale's absolute return portfolio provides an example of the potential of the asset class and
conforms to the expectations generated by considering the fundamental investment attributes
of absolute return strategies. Established as a separate asset class in 1990, the pioneering
portfolio produced 13.2 percent per annum returns for the seventeen years ending June 30,
2007. With a remarkably low risk level of 5.7 percent standard deviation of returns, the
risk/reward relationship indicates that managers exploited some rewarding market anomalies. V
The absolute return portfolio's diversifying power exceeded expectations, showing essentially
no correlation to domestic equities (0.02 vs. the Wilshire 5000 Index) and domestic fixed
income (0.02 vs. the Lehman Brothers Government Corporate Index).
Survivorship Bias and Backfill Bias
Like other alternative assets, absolute return investments lack an investable benchmark, forcing
investors to look elsewhere for defining characteristics of the asset class. Because of absolute
return's limited institutional history, understanding its quantitative attributes proves more
difficult than understanding those of real estate, leveraged buy-outs, and venture capital.
Students of more longstanding alternative investment approaches enjoy the benefit of more
than three decades of data on active manager results that describe the experience of
institutional investors and provide intriguing clues about the character of fund performance.
The paucity of data regarding absolute return strategies requires investors to seek alternative
methods for estimating asset class attributes.
Survivorship bias and backfill bias present a serious problem for investors in marketable
securities. Liquidity facilitates the hiring and firing of stock and bond managers, leading to
churning in the population of active managers. Poor performers leave (survivorship bias) and
strong firms enter (backfill bias), constantly altering the character of the standards implicit in
the collection of returns used for assessing active managers.
Manager churn presents less of a problem for investors in illiquid assets. Managers of private
assets taint the data pool with considerably less frequency than their marketable security
counterparts. Institutions tend to select real estate, venture capital, and leveraged buyout funds
from a reasonably well-defined list of acceptable alternatives, leading to a fairly coherent
definition of any given year's institutional cohort. The partnership vehicles through which
investors conduct most private investing preclude easy departure from the business. Private
investing results-good, bad, or indifferent-play out over the term of the partnership
regardless of the degree of confidence investors express in the fund managers.
Absolute return suffers from particularly acute forms of survivorship bias and backfill bias,
related to the combination of fairly high liquidity and relative immaturity. As large numbers of
new (and not-so-new) entrants fail, the firms and their mediocre records disappear. Immaturity
suggests a substantial amount of flux, as managers posting attractive risk-adjusted returns enter
the realm of institutional acceptability, adding sometimes eye-popping records to the store of
absolute return information. Liquidity allows easy entry and exit, creating instability beneath
the surface of the pool used to evaluate manager returns.
Statistics on past performance of hedge funds fail to provide much insight into the
character of this relatively new segment of the investment world. Survivorship bias presents a
pervasive problem for gatherers of historical return data. The fact that poorly performing firms
fail at higher rates than well-performing firms causes data on manager returns to overstate past
results, since compilations of data at any point in time from the current group of managers
inevitably lack complete performance numbers from firms that failed in the past. In the well-
established, comprehensively documented world of traditional marketable securities,
survivorship bias presents a significant, albeit quantifiable problem. In the less-well-established,
less comprehensively documented arena of hedge fund investing, survivorship bias creates a
much more substantial informational challenge.
Even when database managers attempt to include results from failed firms, the history of
returns often lacks completeness. Because most compilers of data rely on self-reporting of
results by hedge funds, the integrity of the history depends on the fidelity of the hedge funds.
As struggling hedge funds fight to stay in business, reporting of results to third-party database
providers takes a back burner to the day-to-day challenges of crisis management.
Consider the record of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), the infamous hedge
fund that nearly brought down the world's financial system. According to the New York Times,
the database of Tremont Capital Management, a leading purveyor of hedge fund data, contains
LTCM's performance only through October 1997, nearly a year prior to the firm's collapse.
Inception-to-date-of-reporting-cessation performance (March 1994 through October 1997)
for LTCM stood at 32.4 percent per year net to investors, representing an impressive return on
a large amount of capital. Obviously, Long-Term Capital's early record inflated the hedge fund
industry's aggregate results. From the point in October 1997 when Long-Term Capital
stopped reporting results to the point of the firm's October 1998 demise, returns (if they can
be called returns) amounted to -91.8 percent. The staggering loss appears nowhere in
Tremont's treasure trove of data.
The yawning chasm between Tremont's reported 32.4 percent per annum and LTCM's
actual -27.0 percent per annum produces a staggering gap between perception and reality. The
statistical omission of the implosion of LTCM inflates history in a manner that fundamentally
misleads investors regarding the true character of hedge fund investing.
Statistical descriptions of hedge fund returns frequently suffer not only from survivorship
bias, but also from backfill bias. As hedge funds became popular in the 1990s, only those funds
with successful track records rose above the fray, attracting attention from market observers
and money from investors. Funds with mediocre records languished in obscurity. Funds with
strong returns garnered assets and acclaim, entering the consultants' manager universes and
generating a substantial positive spin on the reported returns. In many instances, the keepers of
the numbers added the past results of newly found strong performers to the ranks of the
reporting managers, providing an unrepresentative boost to past performance data. Backfill
bias causes data on hedge fund performance to overstate the realities of the hedge fund
marketplace.
Academic studies that analyze the impact of survivorship bias and backfill bias come to
some stunning conclusions. In a study of 3,500 hedge funds over more than ten years, Roger
Ibbotson of the Yale School of Management concluded that survivorship bias added 2.9
percent annually to returns and backfill bias added an additional 4.6 percent annually to
returns.2 In aggregate, data-gathering errors inflated reported returns by fully 7.5 percent per
annum, an enormous increment in a world where the difference between success and failure
often depends on a few tenths of a percentage point. Burton Malkiel of Princeton University,
in examining a well-known database, observed that of 331 hedge funds that reported results in
1996, more than 75 percent disappeared by 2004.3 As expected, the returns of the live funds
exceeded the returns of the dead funds. Perhaps not so expected was the 7.4 percent annual
return differential between the two groups of funds. For the eight-year period, Malkiel
estimates survivorship bias inflated returns by an average of 4.4 percent per annum and backfill
bias boosted results by an average of 7.3 percent per annum. Ibbotson and Malkicl's studies call
into question the usefulness of hedge fund databases. Survivorship bias and backfill bias
matter.
Hedge Funds with Market-Related Risk
Consider two broad categories of hedge funds-those that avoid market risk and those that
accept market risk. In cases where funds steer clear of market risk, investors without skill
deserve to earn only money-market levels of return. The argument that supports a cash-like
return for investors who do not accept market risk depends on the line of reasoning
underpinning the analysis of long/short manager returns: those hedge fund strategies that do
not expose assets to systematic market risk depend solely on strong active results to achieve
gross results in excess of cash returns.
Many hedge fund strategies expose assets to various types of systematic risk. In fact,
Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch cach created and marketed synthetic hedge funds to mimic
the systematic risk components of the hedge fund world. Merrill Lynch's Factor Index, which
employs the S&P 500, Russell 2000, MSCI Emerging Markets, U.S. Dollar Index, and One-
Month LIBOR, weights each of the components to produce returns similar to those of the
Hedge Fund Research Weighted Composite Index (HFRI). Merrill Lynch touts the strong
relationship between the Factor Index and HFRI, noting a 95 percent correlation between
June 2003 and June 2006. In marketing materials, the investment bank suggests that the Factor
Index produces hedge fund exposure "in a less expensive, more transparent and more liquid
manner."
The notion of a passive hedge fund investment turns logic on its head. Hedge funds rest on
the premise of hedging, or offsetting, market exposure. The idea that hedge fund returns could
be explained and replicated by a collection of passive market indices suggests that managers are
not doing their job and that investors are being sold a bill of goods. If investors really want to
vary exposure to Merrill Lynch's Factor Index components, they should simply alter their
allocations to the S&P 500, Russell 2000, et al. The oxymoron of passive hedge fund exposure
belongs in no serious investor's portfolio.
Perhaps the most blatant example of hedge fund exposure to market forces lies in the long-
only manager that simply establishes a private partnership, calls it a hedge fund, and charges a
20 percent profits interest. In such situations, the manager receives 20 percent of the market's
return, an egregiously high fee for a factor over which the manager exerts no control. Fair fee
structures reward managers for adding value by manipulating variables under the managers'
control. In the case of a fully invested, long-only equity fund, a manager might be reasonably
rewarded with 20 percent of the incremental return over an appropriate market benchmark,
such as the S&P 500 for a large-capitalization domestic equity manager or EAFE for a foreign-
stock specialist. In situations where managers receive a portion of gains over and above a fair
benchmark, the managers receive a reward for adding value. Unfortunately, hedge fund
structures almost universally pay managers a share of the profits after returning capital,
equivalent to no hurdle at all. Without a market-sensitive hurdle rate, managers receive a
percentage of the gains generated by market exposure. The substantial toll imposed by typical
hedge fund fee structures causes the overwhelming number of hedge funds to fail to serve
investor interests.
Evaluating the returns of market-sensitive hedge funds poses nearly insurmountable
problems, challenging to even the most sophisticated of investors. Separating the impact of the
wind at the back (or the wind in the face) contributed by market forces from the influence of
the skill (or lack thereof) exhibited in security selection proves incredibly difficult, particularly
in instances where the manager invests in a broad range of markets and frequently adjusts
market exposure. Regardless of the insight garnered by investors investigating market-sensitive
hedge funds, the investment manager with an industry-standard deal structure receives a share
of the returns generated by market action, representing unreasonable compensation for gains
over which the manager exercises no control.
Absolute Return and Inflation
Since short duration characterizes absolute return investments, well-structured absolute return
portfolios exhibit high sensitivity to the short-term cost of money. In event-driven merger
arbitrage and distressed security transactions, investors generally expect resolution within
months, with longer term deals extending to no more than a year or two. Since event-driven
investors factor the cost of funds into the investment equation, as investors enter new deals the
calculations reflect the then-current cost of funds. Similarly, the short rebate earned by the
value-driven long/short investor represents a short-term cost of money. Just as money market
rates tend to track inflation rates, so does the short-duration, cost-of-funds-sensitive absolute
return portfolio.
Alignment of Interests
The profits interest typically paid by investors in hedge fund structures creates an option for
managers that threatens investor interests. In the event of hedge fund gains, the manager shares
in a substantial portion of profits. In the event of hedge fund losses, the investor bears the
burden alone. The asymmetry of the profits-interest structure clearly favors the fund manager.
Significant co-investment on the part of the manager works to reduce, if not climinate, the
dysfunction of the incentive-compensation option. In the case where the hedge fund
experiences good performance, the manager reaps rewards both from the co-investment and
from the profits interest. In the case where the fund loses money, the manager's co-investment
causes a sharing of the investor's pain. A meaningful side-by-side commitment of investment
manager capital substantially reduces the misalignment of manager and investor interests.
Market Characteristics
At December 31, 2006, the hedge fund industry contained an estimated 12,500 firms,
controlling more than $1.5 trillion in equity capital.5 Moreover, because many hedge funds
employ significant leverage, their actual buying power exceeds their equity capital. Of the $1.5
trillion in capital, approximately $880 billion in assets pursue strategies that might be classified
as absolute return.
Summary
Absolute return strategies require active management, since without accepting market risk or
identifying security mispricings investors expect to earn only the risk-free rate. Since the very
definition of absolute return rests on lack of correlation with traditional marketable securities,
exploitation of individual security valuation anomalies forms the basis of the asset class. Event-
driven managers generate returns by conducting thorough research in complex corners of the
investment opportunity set, an area often avoided by mainstream analysts. Value-driven
managers attempt to add value by identifying undervalued and overvalued securities, creating
portfolios with roughly offsetting long and short market exposures. Well-managed absolute
return portfolios provide a high return, low risk source of diversification.
Absolute return investing appeals to investors who believe that providing funds to superior
managers operating with few constraints will lead to impressive investment results regardless of
the upswings and downswings of traditional marketable securities. Indeed, the experience of a
number of sophisticated institutional investors indicates that well-structured absolute return
portfolios produce high, uncorrelated returns with low risk, adding an extremely valuable
diversifying stream of returns to investor portfolios. Of course, successful absolute return
investors devote an extraordinary amount of resources to identifying, engaging, and managing
high quaility managers.
Purveyors of hedge fund statistics paint a rosy picture wildly at odds with reality. Academic
studies show that survivorship bias and backfill bias combine to inflate reported returns by
anywhere from high single digits to low double digits. A clear view of hedge fund returns
would discourage many thoughtful investors from entering the hedge fund arena.
On top of the enormous difficulties in identifying a group of genuinely skilled investment
managers and overcoming the obstacle of extremely rich fee arrangements, investors confront a
fundamental misalignment of interests created by the option-like payoff embedded in most
hedge fund fee arrangements. Investors find coincidence of interests only in those situations
where the absolute return manager invests substantial personal assets side-by-side with investor
monics.
Casual approaches to fund selection lead to almost certain disappointment. Absolute
return investing belongs in the domain of sophisticated investors who commit significant
resources to the manager evaluation process. While the promise of hedge funds proves
attractive to many market participants, those investors who fail to identify truly superior active
managers face a dismal reality. In the absence of superior security selection, investment
strategies that avoid market exposure deliver money-market-like expected returns. The hefty fee
arrangements typical of absolute return funds crode the already low cash-like return to a truly
unacceptable level, especially after adjusting for risk. Absolute return investors find generating
risk-adjusted excess returns a daunting task.
REAL ASSETS
Real assets consist of ownership interests in investment vehicles that exhibit a high correlation
to inflation. Many investors, including educational endowments, seck protection against
inflation in order to offset inflation-sensitive liabilities. Real assets include Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities, real estate, timber, and oil and gas.
The strength of inflation protection varies with the type of real asset. Treasury Inflation-
Protected Securities (TIPS, also known as Treasury Inflation-Indexed Securities) track inflation
precisely, at least as the Consumer Price Index measures inflation. Oil and gas reserves change
in value in direct response to changes in energy prices, which represent a substantial
component of broad inflation gauges. Timber products bear a similar relationship to price
indices, although timber plays a far less important role than does energy in overall price
inflation. Real estate holdings correlate with inflation less directly than primary inputs like
energy and timber, although when property markets operate in equilibrium a strong link exists
between real estate and inflation.
Aside from protecting portfolios against inflation, real assets produce high levels of current
cash flow and (in most cases) attractive expected total returns. Unlike commodity indices,
which give investors simple price exposure, well-chosen and well-structured real assets
investments provide price exposure plus an intrinsic rate of return. For example, oil and gas
reserve purchases in the past two decades generated low double-digit rates of return above and
beyond the return from holding period increases in energy prices. Price exposure plus an
intrinsic rate of return trumps price exposure alone.
In the future, the population of real assets alternatives might expand beyond the
conservative investments of TIPS and the high-return alternatives of real estate, oil and gas, and
timber. Pure commodity price exposure holds little interest to sensible investors, as long-term
returns approximately equal inflation rates. TIPS provide inflation-like returns with
substantially less risk than commodity investments. Oil and gas reserve purchases and timber
investments provide investors with commodity price exposure and an intrinsic rate of return,
thereby dominating price exposure alone. If markets provide other commodity-based
opportunities to gain price exposure and to earn an intrinsic rate of return, then those assets
could join the rank of sensible real assets alternatives.
Real assets play an important role in portfolios, particularly for investors who seek to satisfy
inflation-sensitive liabilities. The diversifying power derived from correlation with inflation
and the intrinsic rate of return generated above simple price exposure argues for a significant
allocation to real assets.
Inflation-Linked Bonds
In January 1997, the U.S. Treasury began issuing TIPS, creating an important new tool for
U.S.-dollar-based investors. TIPS protect investors from increases in the general level of prices
by adjusting the principal amount of the security for inflation. Since the fixed coupon rate on
TIPS applies to the inflation-adjusted principal of the bonds, both interest and principal
payments reflect changes in inflation rates.
The combination of extraordinary credit quality and precise protection against inflation
causes TIPS to produce modest real returns. During the period that Lehman Brothers tracked
TIPS' real yields, inflation adjusted returns ranged from 1.3 percent to 2.5 percent, averaging
1.9 percent. VI Investors pay a high price in the form of low expected returns from the double-
barreled conservatism of TIPS.
Just as standard U.S. Treasury bonds provide a riskless instrument for investors wishing to
generate certain nominal returns, TIPS provide a riskless instrument for investors wishing to
generate certain real returns. Based on commonality of issuer, default-free status, and structural
similarities in payment of interest and principal, many market observers group standard U.S.
Treasury bonds with TIPS. In fact, when the U.S. Treasury began issuing TIPS, Lehman
Brothers, architect of the most widely used debt market indices, placed TIPS in a cohort that
included regular-issue Treasury bonds.
The error of grouping regular Treasuries with TIPS lies in the fundamentally different
response of the two types of bonds to unanticipated changes in the p level. Unanticipated
inflation harms regular bonds by reducing the purchasing power of the fixed stream of
payments. In contrast, unanticipated inflation benefits TIPS in the form of higher returns as
payments adjust for increases in the price level. Unexpected deflation helps regular bonds by
increasing the purchasing power of the fixed stream of payments. In contrast, unexpected
deflation hurts TIPS by reducing the stream of periodic interest payments, even though
deflation fails to reduce the final principal payment. TIPS, far from belonging with standard
bonds, belong in the real assets category.
A comparison of a traditional U.S. Treasury note and a TIPS security illustrates critical
differences in the two instruments. Consider the U.S. Treasury 4.25 percent Note duc January
15, 2011 and the U.S. Treasury Inflation-Indexed Security 3.5 percent Note duc January 15,
2011. At year-end 2006, the straight bond and the inflation-protected bond boasted yields to
maturity of 4.7 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively. Because the bonds share identical credit
characteristics and identical maturity dates, the difference in yields stems solely from inflation
expectations. The 2.3 percent difference between the straight bond yield and the inflation-
protected bond yield represents the market's best estimate of inflation over the bonds' term. If
inflation exceeds 2.3 percent, the TIPS holder wins. If inflation falls short of 2.3 percent, the
straight bond owner wins.
At maturity, TIPS investors receive a possible bonus, as the bonds pay the greater of the
inflation-adjusted principal or the original face value. In a deflationary world, investors benefit
from the payment of the nondiscounted par amount of the bonds. In an environment of
general price inflation, the right to receive par for the TIPS at maturity carries the greatest valuc
at the time of issuance. In concert with price increases, the indexed value of the bond's
principal increases, creating a surplus over the par value of the bond. Were deflationary
conditions to develop, the accumulated surplus would deplete before the par protection kicked
in. Investors wishing to enjoy the maximum protection of the par put constantly roll holdings
of TIPS into the most recently issued securities.
Some foreign governments issue inflation-protected securities. As with standard bond
issues, U.S.-domiciled investors approach nonU.S. Treasury debt with caution. The United
Kingdom, Canada, Sweden, France, Italy, Germany, Greece, Japan, Australia, and New
Zealand boast substantial programs of inflation-indexed bond issuance. Because foreign
government bonds generally make payments in the currency of the realm, U.S. investors face
foreign exchange risk. The combination of divergent future domestic and foreign inflation
rates and unknown future foreign exchange translations serve to render non-U.S. government
inflation-indexed bonds useless as a hedge against U.S. inflation.
U.S. corporate issuance of inflation-protected securities poses a different set of issues. As is
the case with straight corporate debt, inflation-indexed corporate securities generally suffer
from credit risk, illiquidity, and unattractive call provisions. In addition, investors might
consider the implications of holding corporate inflation-protected securities in a high-inflation
environment. Just when the protection against price increases proves most valuable, the ability
of a corporation to make good on its promises to pay might prove least likely.
TIPS and Inflation
TIPS produce the perfect hedge against inflation, because bond-payment mathematics dictate
direct correspondence between returns and changes in inflation rates. The combination of the
default-free character of full-faith-and-credit obligations of the U.S. government and the
mathematically certain protection against inflation provide investors with a powerful portfolio
tool.
Alignment of Interests
TIPS share with standard-issue Treasury offerings a balance in alignment of interests between
creditor and debtor. Unlike relationships between private borrowers and lenders, in which the
borrower seeks gains at the lender's expense, the government attempts to fashion a fair deal for
partics on both sides of the borrowing transaction.
In promoting TIPS, the Department of the Treasury highlights advantages to both the
creditor and the debtor. From the creditor's perspective, TIPS "provide a distinctive
contribution to any diversified portfolio." From the debtor's perspective, TIPS "allow Treasury
to broaden its investor base and diversify its funding risks."6 The evenhanded approach to
debtor and creditor separates the U.S. government from profit-secking private-sector
borrowers.
Market Characteristics
At December 31, 2006, outstanding issues of TIPS amounted to only $369 billion. First issued
by the U.S. Treasury in January 1997, the program provides a valuable, diversifying alternative
for investors. At year-end 2006, TIPS promised a real (after-inflation) yield of 2.4 percent with
an average maturity of 9.6 years and a duration of 6.4 years.
Summary
Although TIPS amount to only around 17 percent of the value of standard Treasury bonds,
inflation-sensitive TIPS constitute a compelling addition to the tool set available to investors.
Bolstered by the default-free, full-faith-and-credit backing of the U.S. government, TIPS serve
as a benchmark against which to measure other inflation-sensitive investments.
Real Estate
Investments in real estate provide investors with exposure to the benefits and risks of owning
office properties, apartment complexes, industrial warehouses, and retail establishments. High
quality real estate holdings produce significant levels of current cash flow generated by long-
term, in-place lease arrangements with creditworthy tenants. Properties that produce sustained
levels of high cash flow exhibit stable valuations, as a substantial portion of asset value stems
from relatively predictable cash flows. In contrast, properties that produce uncertain cash
flows, as in the case where leases approach expiration and owners face re-leasing risk, show near-
term variability in residual value. In the extreme case of properties that produce no cash flow,
real estate takes on a speculative aura as valuation depends entirely on prospective leasing
activity.
Real estate assets combine characteristics of fixed income and equity. Fixed income
attributes stem from the contractual obligation of tenants to make regular payments as
specified in the lease contract between tenant and landlord. Properties encumbered by long-
term lease obligations exhibit predominantly bond-like qualitics. Equity attributes stem from
the residual value associated with leases expected to be executed for currently vacant space or
for anticipated future vacancies. Properties without tenants or with tenants on short leases
exhibit predominantly equity-like qualities.
Archetypal real estate investments consist of well-lo ed, well-leased, high quality
properties that allow investors to anticipate regular receipt of rental income from leased space
and to expect income within a reasonable time frame from vacant space. Real estate with a
significant operating component fails to meet the set of core investment criteria, as the
operational attributes largely determine the investment outcome, creating an equity-like
investment play. Core investments do not include raw land, ground-up development activity
and hotel operations, primarily because these investments rely substantially on operating
expertise to produce cash flows.
Risk and Return Characteristics
Real estate returns and risks fall between those of bonds and equities. With bond-like rental
streams and equity-like residual values, investors expect real estate to produce results
somewhere between the results of the bond market and the stock market. Ibbotson Associates
data for the past eighty years indicate that stocks returned 10.4 percent annually and
government bonds 5.4 percent annually. Splitting the difference suggests that real estate
investors might realistically expect returns in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent per annum
above bonds.
Nearly two decades of data confirm the notion that real estate returns fall between stocks
and bonds. Returns covering 1987 to 2006 for a broad-based index of real estate holdings stand
at 8.4 perce
per annum, poised between the 11.8 perc
per annum return for the S&P 500
and the 6.5 percent per annum return for intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds.7 Capital
markets history confirms expectations regarding relative returns for real estate.
Valuation of real estate poses less of a challenge than does valuation of many other risky
assets. Consider the fact that, with markets in equilibrium, replacement cost for existing assets
constitutes an important determinant of market value. In fact, the real estate market provides a
powerful example of the efficacy of Tobin's "q," the ratio between market value and
replacement cost of an asset. If the market value of a particular real estate asset exceeds
replacement cost, nearby real estate development of a similar product type makes economic
sense. Clearly, under such circumstances, the income yield expressed as a percentage of cost of a
newly constructed building would exceed the income yield on the more highly valued existing
asset, creating incentives to build new, high-yielding buildings. Conversely, if replacement cost
exceeds market value, real estate development makes no economic scnsc. In such a situation,
the income yield on cost falls short of the income yield on less highly valued existing assets.
Instead of building new buildings, rational market participants buy existing properties, thereby
driving market values toward replacement cost.
Tobin's "q" proves particularly useful in the real estate market, because replacement cost
constitutes a readily determinable, easily observable variable. While in the stock market Tobin's
"q" produces insight into valuation of individual companies, broad market sectors, and even
the entire equity market, the challenges of determining replacement cost of today's complex,
far-flung corporate entities proves daunting. In contrast, assessing the cost of constructing a
suburban retail mall or a downtown office building proves far more manageable. In fact, many
knowledgeable investors assess an asset's cost of replication and then use discount to
replacement cost as an important investment criterion when making real estate acquisitions.
Public versus Private Holdings
Real estate investments hold the unusual distinction of offering large numbers of investment
vehicles in both publicly traded and privately held categories. The distinction between public
and private positions in real estate lies in form, not substance. Both public and private holdings
of real estate assets expose investors to the benefits and perils of property positions.
Many investors in real estate benefit from an unusual investment vehicle, the real estate
investment trust, or REIT. A REIT, unlike a typical corporate entity, pays no income taxes as
long as the REIT distributes at least 90 percent of its taxable income and generates at least 75
percent of that income from rents, mortgages, and sales of property. REITs serve as a pass-
through structure in which income passes through the security, without being taxed, to the
security holders who take responsibility for the tax liability, if any. REITs exist in both publicly
traded and privately held forms.
Even though both publicly traded and privately held real estate vehicles expose investors to
real estate assets, public-market securities frequently trade at prices that deviate from fair value.
Green Street Advisors, a highly regarded research firm that concentrates on publicly traded real
estate securities, routinely examines discrepancies between market price and fair value. The
results give short-term investors pause. At one point in 1990, by Green Street's estimate, real
estate securities traded at more than a 36 percent discount to fair value. By 1993, the stock
market reversed itself, valuing real-estate-related holdings at a 28 percent premium to fair value.
The yin and yang continued. In late 1994, the discount reached 9 percent, while in 1997, stock
market investors paid more than a 33 percent premium to fair value. In the late 1990s, a poor
market for real estate securities (that coincided with a wonderful market for most other
securities) brought valuations to a deficit of more than 20 percent, a level reached in early 2000.
As the non-real-estate portion of the stock market entered bear territory, real estate securities
took on bullish characteristics, leading to a greater-than-22-percent premium to fair value in
carly 2004. At year-end 2006, security prices stood at a not-too-hot and not-too-cold 2 percent
premium over fair value. The wide swings between price and fair value in the public securities
arena produced low correlation between returns of publicly traded and privately held real
estate assets, 10
Discrepancies between price and fair value disturb careless short-term players, because any
premium paid on purchases and any deficit incurred on sales loom large in damaging holding-
period returns. For canny investors, deviations between price and fair value allow purchases at a
discount and sales at a premium, buying low and selling high to enhance portfolio returns.
Longer term investors face fewer issues regarding differences between price and fair valuc,
because over longer investment horizons the short-term noise in the price/fair-value
relationship matters less. Careful investors either exploit price/fair-value differences or employ
dollar-cost averaging to enter and exit markets that deviate measurably from fair value.
Although exceptions exist, publicly traded real estate securities generally provide reasonably
low-cost exposure to relatively high quaility pools of real estate assets. Discrepancies between
market price and fair value create opportunities for investors to build portfolios using relatively
attractively priced assets. When REITs fall from favor, research analysts explain why the
publicly traded shares deserve a permanent discount to privately held assets, with justifications
ranging from illiquidity, management ineptitude, and high overhead costs, to the inflexibility
of REIT structures. When REITs ride high, the same analysts argue that public vehicles
command a premium for good reasons, including liquidity, management expertise, economies
of scale, and advantages of the REIT format. Regardless of the idea of the moment, sensible
investors favor REITs when portfolios trade at a discount to private market value and avoid
REITs when shares trade at a premium.
Active Management
Inefficiencies in the pricing and operation of real estate assets create opportunity for active
management. Investors increase return and lower risk by exercising careful judgment in
selecting assets and by using diligence in managing properties.
Real estate lends itself to active management because mispricings create opportunities for
nimble investors to take advantage of market anomalies. The task of identifying underpriced
and overpriced properties poses surmountable hurdles, since valuations depend largely on
readily observed variables. Calculation of replacement cost for an asset provides important
information on the value of a well-located property. Information on leases in place, combined
with projections of future lease rates and an estimate of residual value, produce an easily
analyzed stream of cash flows. Sales of comparable properties provide hard numbers reflecting
the willingness of investors to pay for bricks and mortar or a stream of expected cash flows.
Active management decisions for real estate rest on the fundamental characteristics of
replacement cost, discounted cash flows, and sales of similar assets, providing clear reference
points unavailable for most other asset types.
Sony Building Acquisition Douglas Emmett's 1993 acquisition of the Sony Building in
Burbank, California illustrates some important valuation tools. Los Angeles ranked among the
hardest hit markets in the real estate debacle of the early 1990s, with vacancy rates reaching a
staggering 24 percent for Class A office space in the metropolitan market. As a result, prices for
office buildings declined dramatically. In a signature transaction, Sam Zell, the famed "grave
dancer," bought Two California Plaza for $100 million, approximately one quarter of what it
cost to build a few years earlier.
Nearby Burbank, a distinctly different market with substantially stronger underlying
fundamentals, experienced sympathetic price declines, suffering by association with Los
Angeles. Amid the tumult, as part of a corporate rationalization program, Coca Cola decided
to sell the Burbank property housing its former subsidiary, Sony Pictures. The sales price of
$83 million compared favorably to the building's construction cost of more than $120 million,
providing the purchaser a 30 percent discount to replacement cost.
Cash flow from lease payments further supported the acquisition. One hundred percent of
the space was leased to Sony, at the time a credit rated single A by Standard & Poor's. If the
investor received only those payments guaranteed by Sony, all invested capital would be repaid
along with sufficient excess cash flow to generate annual returns of 123 percent. This low
double digit return included no estimate of residual value for the building upon expiration of
the lease. With reasonable assumptions regarding lease renewals and residual value, returns
jumped to the 20 percent to 25 percent range. In an interest rate environment where
comparable maturity U.S. Treasury Notes yielded about 6.5 percent, the relatively high quality
Sony payment stream represented a handsome baseline return for a deal with substantial upside
and little downside.
Comparable sales data tell less about the attractiveness of the Sony acquisition than about
the timing. The lack of bids for the Sony Building and other properties in the area signaled a
contrarian opportunity to buy deeply out-of-favor assets, not a lack of value. Fortified by
substantial discounts to replacement cost and high levels of investment grade cash flow,
investors move forward with confidence in the face of dismal market conditions. When the
tone of the market improves to the point that real estate players pronounce that asset
irreplacability justifics paying a meaningful premium to replacement cost and that a tight
leasing environment presages transformation of low current cash yields into higher future cash
flows, contrarian investors offer properties for sale.
The striking Sony building, with its handsome tenant finishes, promised a more-than-
satisfactory baseline return with the protection of a purchase price substantially below
replacement cost. VII The limited downside of the Sony Building along with substantial
potential upside created a positively skewed distribution of outcomes, providing extremely
attractive investment characteristics.
In fact, the Sony Building's appealing acquisition characteristics translated into an equally
appealing investment outcome. When Douglas Emmett converted the firm's pool of real estate
assets into a REIT in October 2006, each of the assets received a third party appraisal to
support the valuation and allocation of REIT shares. Based on the appraised value, the Sony
building (now called Studio Plaza) generated a holding period return in excess of 20 percent
per annum. Ultimately, Douglas Emmett's investors reaped rich rewards for the firm's
contrarian instincts and real estate management expertise.
**
Manager Specialization Investors generally benefit from engaging specialists to manage a
fund's commitment to real estate. Experts in a particular geography and a particular property
type-office, retail, residential, industrial-enjoy a substantial edge over generalist managers,
who suffer from spreading resources an inch deep and a mile wide. Specialization leads to
greater understanding of the particular dynamics of different markets, allowing one manager to
focus on the relatively static mass of central business district office buildings and another
manager to focus on the ever-changing inventory of suburban office properties. Similarly, one
manager might specialize in massive department store anchored malls and another might
specialize in smaller infill community retail centers. By concentrating management resources
on a fairly narrowly defined market segment, fund managers make better buys, better sales, and
better day-to-day asset management decisions.
Investors choosing to select a group of valuation-driven specialist managers create more
powerful portfolios, albeit at the price of a loss of diversification. By pursuing attractive
investment opportunities, selected on a bottom-up basis, funds develop concentrations in the
most out-of-favor asset types. For instance, prompted by relative valuations, investors may at
times hold outsized positions in California retail properties or Southeastern suburban office
buildings, creating a profile with dramatic deviations from the characteristics of any broad-
based real estate index. Even though idiosyncratic portfolios tend to exhibit substantial
tracking error relative to the market, a carefully chosen group of niche managers contains the
potential to produce outstanding investment results.
Real Estate Prices and Inflation
The strong relationship between replacement cost and market value leads to one of real estate's
most attractive investment attributes, a high correlation with inflation. Since the labor and
materials used to construct buildings rise in cost along with inflation, the replacement cost of
real estate tracks inflation closely. Yet even though replacement cost responds to changes in the
general price level, the nature of an asset's lease structure influences the rate of response of
changes in market value to inflationary pressures. For example, a property subject to long-term,
fixed-rate leases shows little near-term correlation to inflation. Only as lease expiration nears
will inflation influence asset valuation. Alternatively, properties with shorter-term leases exhibit
much greater inflation sensitivity. Moreover, some leases explicitly allow landlords to pass
through inflationary increases in expenses or, in the case of retail properties, contractually
entitle landlords to receive a percentage of sales. Such inflation-responsive lease structures cause
asset values to reflect inflationary moves.
The importance of replacement cost both in valuation analysis and in inflation sensitivity
relies on markets reflecting reasonable equilibrium between supply and demand. In cases where
supply of real estate space fails to match demand, prices respond to the disequilibrium, not to
the expected relationship with replacement cost or with inflation. In the late 1980s, investor
enthusiasm for owning commercial real estate and federal tax incentives for developing
properties combined to create a vast oversupply of commercial office buildings. The excesses in
the real estate market contributed to the savings and loan crisis, as many thrifts suffered from
the burden of underperforming or non-performing real estate loans. High quality, albeit
poorly leased, properties traded at steep discounts to replacement cost. Prices responded to the
disconnect between supply and demand, failing to track inflation. Similarly, in the early 2000s,
a post-Internet-bubble decline in demand for office space led to widespread vacancies and a
decline in real estate prices, resulting in a disequilibrium that decoupled falling real estate prices
from consistently positive levels of inflation. Unless markets operate in reasonable equilibrium,
the relationship between real estate prices and inflation breaks down. Yet when markets exhibit
equilibrium, sensitivity to changes in the general price level represents a particularly attractive
characteristic of real estate.
Alignment of Interests
In the realm of publicly traded REITs, investors face the same set of questions about alignment
of interests that apply to other publicly traded equities. Just as in the broader universe of
marketable stocks, interests of shareholders and managements generally, but imperfectly,
coincide.
In the world of private real estate vehicles, investors face a range of investment structures.
On one end of the continuum, high quality managers receive budgeted fees that reflect
reasonable costs of running an investment firm, receive profits interests only on returns in
excess of the opportunity cost of capital, and invest substantial assets side-by-side with
investors. On the other end of the continuum, low quality managers charge high fees on large
pools of assets, extract profits interests on returns in excess of investor capital contributions and
invest O.P.M., other people's money.
Market Characteristics
Real estate investors face significant investment opportunities in both public and private
markets. At December 31, 2006, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
tracked a universe of real estate securities that totaled $436 billion. The REIT population
posted a dividend yield of 3.3 percent and traded at a 2.2 percent premium over fair value.
At December 31, 2006, the NCREIF National Property Index included unleveraged real
estate assets valued at an aggregate of $247 billion. The privately held real estate cohort paid a
dividend yield of 6.2 percent, which represented a premium 1.5 percent over the ten-year U.S.
Treasury yield.
Summary
In terms of risk and return, real estate falls between higher risk equity and lower risk debt. The
hybrid nature of the expected investment characteristics matches the hybrid nature of the
fundamental traits of real estate investments. With its inflation-sensitive nature, real estate
provides powerful diversification to investor portfolios.
Real estate investors enjoy the opportunity to choose between publicly traded and privately
held investment vehicles. While sensible alternatives exist in both public and private forms,
careful investors pay close attention to fee arrangements and look hard at manager quality.
Oil and Gas
Oil and gas investments provide claims on future streams of inflation-sensitive income,
supplying protection against unanticipated inflation and playing an important role in portfolio
diversification. In addition to furnishing attractive diversifying characteristics, oil and gas assets
present opportunities for superior managers to add value.
Market participants gain exposure to energy assets either by acquiring futures contracts or
by purchasing oil and gas reserves; whether through futures positions or reserve acquisitions,
investors seek price-driven returns. In order to gain commodity exposure without betting
exclusively on prices, savvy investors structure portfolios around value-added purchases of well-
defined energy reserves operated by superior management teams.
Oil and gas reserve purchases boast a number of advantages over the simple price exposure
provided by futures contracts. First, reserve acquisitions tend to produce high, cquity-like
expected returns. Over the past two decades, well-structured investments in low-risk producing
reserves typically generated low double-digit unleveraged returns, without considering price
movements. Second, superior active managers add value in the process of acquiring,
developing, financing, operating, and liquidating assets. Expertise and discipline create more
value in the complex physical world of natural resources than in the highly efficient financial
world of commodities markets. Finally, long duration energy reserves provide a long-term
hedge against sustained periods of high energy prices.
Public versus Private Holdings
Ironically, diversified portfolios of public securities produce less transparent and less effective
exposure to energy prices than do focused private acquisitions of energy reserves. In the realm
of publicly traded energy companies, investors face questions regarding the degree to which
integrated oil companies consume oil and gas (as inputs to the refining process, for example)
and the degree to which companies produce oil and gas (as outputs of the exploration process,
for example). Even if investors successfully determine the net corporate exposure to energy
prices, the question of company hedging policies remains. Broadly diversified, publicly traded
companies provide uncertain exposure to energy prices, leading real assets investors to prefer
pure private reserve acquisition plays.
Active Management
Purchases of oil and gas reserves by high quality active managers provide investors with the
opportunity to gain exposure to energy prices and to earn a significant baseline rate of return.
Merit Energy Company, founded in 1989 by Bill Gayden, a former colleague of Ross Perot,
successfully delivered on the twin promises of handsome returns from disciplined
underwriting and substantial portfolio diversification from energy price exposure.
Merit typically acquires low-risk oil and gas reserves using assumptions that produce a 12
percent to 14 percent return without assuming energy price appreciation or depreciation. In a
remarkable coincidence between acquisition assumptions and subsequent reality, from 1990 to
2005, Merit produced net returns of 19.2 percent per annum, which consisted of 12.2 percent
from acquisition economics, 21 percent from improved operations and development, and 4.9
percent from price appreciation.
Presumably, investors in energy price futures would have obtained only the roughly 5
percent per annum price appreciation. Investors in reserve purchase programs received double-
digit returns above and beyond the price movement, dominating the results of the commodity
futures investors.
Energy Prices and Inflation
Energy investments belong in the real assets portfolio because of their strong correlation with
inflation. Energy constitutes roughly nine percent of the Consumer Price Index (CPI), creating
a direct link to inflation. Unsurprisingly, an Ibbotson Associates study found a positive
correlation between direct energy production investments and CPI, using data for the period
from 1970 to 1998,11 In contrast, Ibbotson found a negative correlation between direct energy
investments and a variety of marketable securities, including domestic stocks, foreign stocks,
Treasury bonds, and Treasury bills. Both statistics and common sense support the idea of
energy investments as a hedge against inflation.
Alignment of Interests
The old saw-that sensible investors never back an energy partnership touted on Wall Street,
because all the good deals come together in Houston-contains some truth. Poorly structured
oil and gas partnerships abound. Unscrupulous operators gain advantage over naïve investors
by exploiting the complexities of industry-specific concepts such as net profits interests,
overriding royalty interests, working interests, net revenue interests, and operating interests.
That said, by following sensible deal structuring principles, including a high level of co-
investment by the deal's promoter, investors create the opportunity to enjoy the significant
benefits of investments in producing oil and gas reserves.
Market Characteristics
Oil and gas investors confront a broad tableau, including marketable energy equities of $4.6
trillion, representing 10 percent of global equities as of December 31, 2006. Institutional
private investments amounted to $28 billion on December 31, 2006, according to Cambridge
Associates, of which $20 billion pursued energy reserve purchases.
Summary
Energy investments provide dramatic diversification to institutional portfolios, as energy prices
show negative correlation to traditional securities over many time periods. Pure price exposure,
as obtained through the purchase of energy futures contracts, comes at a high price in the form
of low expected return. Sensible investors opt for reserve purchase programs that promise price
exposure (along with the accompanying diversification) and returns in the low double-digit
range. Perhaps more than in any other investment activity, investors must be wary of low
quality operators with opaque, egregious deal structures.
Timber
Timberland offers strong return potential, steady cash flow, inflation protection, and portfolio
diversification. Investment returns stem from several sources, the most important being the
value of timber harvested and changes in the value of residual timber and land. Timber values,
which relate to the biological growth of trees and changes in timber prices, can be influenced
by sound silvicultural practices. The sale of conservation casements and land parcels for
"higher and better use" (HBU) provide the potential to boost returns. Finally, incremental
revenue can be generated through other activities, including leasing of land for the exploitation
of mineral deposits, recreational pastimes, and alternative energy uses.
Historically, timber has performed well as an investment, although accurate data are
difficult to obtain. The most frequently cited series, first created by Hancock Timber Resource
Group, combines known timber prices with assumptions about forest growth and value to
generate a timberland return series beginning in 1960.VIII Hancock/NCREIF estimates that
U.S. timberland returned 12.7 percent per annum from 1960 through 2005, or roughly 8.1
percent per annum after i ion. Since 1987, the NCREIF Timberland Property Inde
produced a cash yield of approximately 6 percent per annum.
In addition to generating strong returns, timberland provides diversification relative to
securities markets: the Hancock/NCREIF index exhibited a correlation of -0.17 with the S&P
500. In part, low correlation stems from the consistent return to timberland from biological
growth. While the S&P 500 produced a calendar loss cleven times since 1960, the timberland
index generated a loss in only one of those eleven years and losses on only three years overall.
Like other real assets, timberland serves as a hedge against unanticipated inflation. Because
timber is a basic production input for a number of end products, changes in timber prices
correlate strongly with inflation.
Timberland Ownership
The U.S. Forest Service classifics approximately 22 percent of the United States as timberland,
or land capable of producing industrial wood.ix Federal, state, and local governments own
nearly 30 percent of U.S. timberland, with a higher ownership percentage in the Pacific
Northwest and a lower percentage in the South. Nonindustrial users hold approximately 80
percent of privately owned timberland, much of it not suitable for institutional investment.
The Hancock Group estimates the investable universe is only 20 percent to 30 percent of
nonindustrial private timberland, with the remainder consisting of small, low quality or poorly
located tracts. Combining industrial timberland with investable nonindustrial private
timberland gives a total U.S. investable timberland base of approximately $125 billion. By
comparison, the value of investable real estate in the United States is approximately $3.5
trillion.X
In recent years, ownership of timberland in the United States shifted from forest products
companies to institutional investors. At one time, companies viewed timberland ownership as
essential, providing mills with a captive, dependable source of raw materials. Over time, the
inefficiencies in ownership and management of forestry assets became apparent as trees were
cut without regard to economic value to keep a steady supply of wood arriving at the mill.
Several large companies that separated the mill operations and timber operations into
independent entities saw dramatic bottom-line improvements in both segments.
Once companies viewed timberland assets as distinct from the core wood processing
business, companies became less attached to holding massive wood inventories and more
focused on the benefits of selling timberlands. First, timberland sales offered a means of raising
capital to modernize mills, streamline operations, or pay down debt. Second, timberland sales
offered the opportunity to boost stock prices through the realization of hidden value and by
raising returns on capital. Finally, some companies divested U.S. holdings to move into lower
cost, higher productivity timberlands in other regions of the world.
Over the past decade, approximately 33 million acres of timber-land traded in the United
States with annual sales averaging 2.6 percent of the investable timberland universe. Most
timberland on the selling block ended up in the hands of newly created timberland REITs or
newly interested institutional investors. The new owners often did not own mill assets,
allowing them to focus exclusively on maximizing the value of the timberlands. As a result, the
new owners adopted more sophisticated financially driven silvicultural techniques, more
extensive merchandising operations, and more aggressive monetization strategies for
nontimber values.
Timber Pricing
As with any other product, the locus of supply and demand drives timber prices. Local,
national, and global dynamics all influence the price a landowner receives for logs.
At a local level, the supply of timber depends on everything from weather conditions to the
availability of loggers. Timber demand at a local level derives from mills which purchase
delivered logs or buy stumpage from timberland owners.XI Because of the high costs of
transporting logs, proximity to a mill influences the price a timberland owner receives for logs.
Mill closures diminish local demand for logs, pushing prices lower. On the flip side, new mills
and mill modernization programs drive prices higher.
Ultimately, end product demand supports timber prices. Industries important to timber
demand include construction (both new home construction and renovations), paper and
packaging, and furnishings. Lumber and wood panel products, for example, which are heavily
used in construction and remodeling make up over 50 percent of U.S. wood product
production. Strong levels of new home construction, home renovations, and GDP growth
translate into strong demand for lumber. The inverse holds true, as weak end product demand
leads to mill closures and weak timber prices.
Over short time horizons, timber prices experience swings driven by end product demand
cyclicality. Over a longer time horizon, timber prices benefit from increasing global demand for
forest products. However, secular demand trends for certain products do not support
increased demand for certain types of timber. For example, in recent years, increased use of
electronic media led to reduced growth in demand for paper, paperboard, and newsprint.
However, many other timber end products have less obvious or cost effective substitutes.
Lumber, for example, remains a cheap and efficient construction material, with no serious
substitutes on the horizon.
Differences in end product demand drive variations in prices for different timber species
and grades. Determinants of prices for small, low-quality trees used for pulp differ from those
that influence prices for large, high quality trees used in furniture production. In addition,
changing technologies create relative price differentials among types of timber. For example,
the development of oriented strand board (OSB), a panel of material made from stacked sheets
of narrow wood strips, has led to a decrease in demand for plywood and the large diameter logs
required to make plywood.
International dynamics affect timber supply and demand, as imports and exports of wood
products play a significant role in determining timber prices. While approximately 11 percent
of the U.S. harvest is exported, imports, primarily from Canada, account for nearly 25 percent
of U.S. forest products consumption. U.S. dollar-Canadian dollar currency fluctuations
strongly influence U.S. forest product and timber prices.
Active Management
Investments in timberland follow two principles that underlie attractive real assets investments.
First, discounted pricing contributes to high risk-adjusted returns. In the case of timber,
investors seek substantial discounts to the metric of standing timber value. Second,
opportunities to create value independent of market or commodity price fluctuations add to
the attractiveness of timber investments.
Active management plays a somewhat less critical role in real estate, energy, and timber
investments than it does in illiquid investments in leveraged buyouts and venture capital.
Because the assets themselves drive a substantial portion of real estate, energy, and timber
returns, investors receive the asset-based returns even in the absence of stellar active
management. In contrast, without superb active management, investments in venture capital
make no sense at all.
Timber Prices and Inflation
Timberland shines during periods of high inflation and market turmoil. In the inflationary
years of 1973 and 1974, for example, the S&P 500 returned an annualized -20.8 percent. After
adjusting for inflation of 10.5 percent per year, the S&P generated an annualized return of an
even more dismal -28.3 percent. Over those same two years, however, timberland returned a
nominal 36.6 percent per year, equating to an annualized real return of 23.7 percent. That said,
because links to inflation require that markets operate in reasonable equilibrium, secular trends
that influence end-product demand might overwhelm short-term inflation sensitivity,
disappointing the inflation hedging aspirations of timberland investors.
Alignment of Interests
Timber investment management organizations (TIMOs) provide a vehicle through which
investors might participate in timberland investments. In the 1990s, when institutional
investors began to show interest in timber, the existing TIMOs exhibited a variety of problems.
Many were owned by large banks or insurance companies, creating the potential for conflicts
between the interests of the financial conglomerate and the interests of the institutional
timberland investor. Further limiting the set of attractive alternatives, a number of TIMOs
employed unappealing allocation models, either allocating investments to specific investors on
a first-come, first-served basis or on a subjective assessment of client needs and preferences. Few
TIMOs sported sensible structures.
Today, a number of TIMOs meet reasonable institutional standards, with independent
organizations offering well-structured com-mingled funds that contain fair deal terms. Even so,
investors must continue to look out for and avoid the structural deficits that plagued the
timber management industry in the 1990s.
Market Characteristics
According to Cambridge Associates, as of December 31, 2006, thirty TIMOs managed a total
of $5.9 billion in commingled funds. Separate institutional accounts managed by those same
TIMOs amount to an additional $14.0 billion. Timber REITs provide a further $11.9 billion
of investment opportunity.
Summary
Timber offers institutional portfolios an opportunity to realize high risk-adjusted returns and a
degree of protection against unanticipated inflation. Along with real estate and energy
investments, timber provides a hedge against inflation without the significant opportunity
costs of investment in TIPS.
Sustainable harvests of timberland produce substantial cash flows, similar to the high
income levels characteristic of other real assets investments. The inefficiencies in the illiquid
markets for timber create opportunities for high quality managers to add substantial value.
Timber represents a valuable addition to the set of institutional investment alternatives.
PRIVATE EQUITY
Properly selected investments in leveraged buyouts and venture capital generate high returns
relative to other equity alternatives, enhancing overall portfolio results. Superior private equity
returns come at the price of higher risk levels, as investors expose assets to greater financial
leverage (in the case of buyouts) and more substantial operating uncertainty (in the case of
venture capital). Because of the strong fundamental links between private equity investments
and marketable equities, private equity provides limited diversification to investors.
Private equity investments overcome the problems associated with divergence of interests
between shareholders and management evident in many of today's publicly traded companies.
Separation of ownership (by shareholders) and control (by management) results in a
substantial gap between the interests of shareholders and the actions of management, since
without significant equity interests managers often pursue a wide range of activities designed
to improve their lot at the expense of outside owners. Over-the-top offices, excessive salaries,
bloated fleets of airplanes, and other unjustified managerial perquisites rarely enter the picture
in profit-oriented private investments. Private company managements operate with longer time
horizons and lower risk aversion, aggressively pursuing strategies that promote creation of
enterprise value. Because private deals generally require management to take material
ownership stakes, interests of outside owners and operating management align.
In the venture capital world, entrepreneurial start-ups engage individuals who exhibit a
single-minded focus on building successful companies. In the realm of buyouts, companies
attract management devoted to improving the operation's bottom line, addressing the
challenges of a highly leveraged capital structure with the goal of achieving a profitable exit.
Managements in buyout and venture deals share the goals and objectives of owners.
In spite of differences between the technology orientation of traditional venture capital and
the mature business bias of the leveraged buyout arena, discussions of private equity generally
include both venture and buyout investments. In addition to the shared characteristics of
illiquidity and high return potential, venture and buyout investing embrace a scope of activities
that share important attributes with marketable equities.
Leveraged buyouts respond to many of the same factors that influence marketable
securities. In fact, in transactions driven solely by financial engineering, buyouts simply
represent turbo-charged equity, with leverage magnifying the results-good or bad-produced
by a particular company. For example, when Warburg Pincus took Bausch & Lomb private in a
2007 leveraged buyout transaction, the fundamental nature of the company's consumer
products business remained the same. Bausch & Lomb continued as the self-described "eye
health company dedicated to perfecting vision and enhancing life for consumers around the
world."12 Corporate valuation continued to respond to changes in consumer demand,
commodity prices, production efficiency, and regulatory activity. The underlying similarity
between the publicly traded Bausch & Lomb and the privately held Bausch & Lomb suggests
that investors should expect high levels of correlation between marketable securities and
leveraged buyouts.
Although early stage venture capital lacks strong links with marketable equities, later stage
venture investing depends significantly on the stock market. Later stage venture investments
provide capital for companies ready to go public or to be sold, buying the company time to
wait for a ready public market or an attractive corporate suitor. Market action influences the
price at which later stage venture investors enter an investment and plays an even more critical
role in the price at which investors exit successful positions.
Even early stage valuations respond somewhat to equity market conditions. When
entrepreneurs start companies in an industry favored by the equity markets, venture capitalists
pay premium prices to participate. Conversely, less highly desired enterprises command lower
entry valuations, providing investors with relatively attractive starting points. As companies
mature, equity market conditions increasingly influence venture capital valuations.
In their most basic form, venture and buyout investing represent a riskier means of
obtaining equity exposure. The high leverage inherent in buyout transactions and the
corporate immaturity intrinsic to venture investments cause investors to experience greater
fundamental risk and to expect materially higher investment returns.
Strangely, historical results generally fail to reflect the hoped-for enhanced returns, while
both correlation measures and risk levels fall below expectations. Unfortunately, poor returns
for private investing probably reflect reality while the lower-than-expected correlation and
lower-than-expected risk constitute a statistical artifact. Illiquidity masks the relationship
between fundamental drivers of company value and changes in market price, causing private
equity's diversifying power to appear artificially high. If two otherwise identical companies
differ only in the form of organization-one private, the other public-the infrequently and
less aggressively valued private company appears much more stable than the frequently valued
publicly traded company, particularly in a world where securities markets exhibit excess
volatility. Even though both companies react in identical fashion to fundamental drivers of
corporate value, the less volatile private entity boasts superior risk characteristics, based solely
on mis-measurement of the company's true underlying volatility. Not only does lack of day-to-
day valuation information reduce reported risk levels, the private company gains spurious
diversifying characteristics based solely on lack of co-movement with the more frequently
valued public company.
While a fair portion of the observed "diversification provided by private equity stems from
the infrequent valuations accorded illiquid assets, some lack of correlation between marketable
and private assets results from value-added strategies pursued by private firms. Consider the
case of an idea, a garage and an entrepreneur financed with venture capital. As the company
develops its product, initiates sales and becomes profitable, value creation takes place
independent of the action on the floor of the stock exchange. Because results from company
building activities loom large relative to results from the original corporate base, venture
investments provide diversification relative to traditional marketable securities.
Similar value-added possibilities exist in the leveraged buyout arena, allowing adept private
investors to enhance returns by achieving operating improvements in portfolio companies.
Because buyout transactions generally involve companies with a reasonably substantial
corporate base, market influences play the primary role in valuation, with firm-specific value-
added opportunities playing a secondary role. Even though when compared to venture capital
investments the more mature buyout companies offer less dramatic opportunities for business
growth, value-added strategies contain the potential to offer a source of uncorrelated returns.
Pure financial engineering holds little interest for serious private equity investors, since
providing financing represents a commodity-like activity with low barriers to entry. In the
leveraged buyout business, simply adding leverage to a company increases expected returns and
boosts risk levels, doing nothing to promote the goal of achieving risk-adjusted returns. In the
venture capital arena, later stage investors supply little more than cash, hoping to benefit from
the work of early stage investors and the prospect of achieving rapid liquidity through an initial
public offering or sale. Private investors offering only capital operate in an extremely
competitive market with reasonably efficient pricing mechanisms and little opportunity to
demonstrate an investment edge.
Private equity opportunities become compelling only when managers pursue well-
considered value-added strategies. By seeking to improve corporate operations in the context of
an appropriate financial structure, investors increase the scope of return-generating activity,
allowing realization of superior results less dependent on the whims of the market.
Leveraged Buyouts
Leveraged buyout transactions involve private ownership of mature corporate entities with
greater-than-usual levels of debt on their balance sheets. The high levels of leverage produce a
correspondingly high degree of variability in outcomes, both good and bad. Leveraged buyout
investments, in the absence of value-adding activities by the transaction sponsor, simply
increase the risk profile of the company.
The increase in risk generally comes at a high price. Buyout partnerships charge substantial
management fees (often ranging between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent of committed funds), a
significant profits interest (usually 20 percent), and a variety of transactions and monitoring
fees. The general partners of many buyout funds suggest that they engage in more than simple
financial engineering, arguing that they bring special value-creation skills to the table. While
the value added by operationally oriented buyout partnerships may, in certain instances,
overcome the burden imposed by the typical buyout fund's generous fee structure, in aggregate
buyout investments fail to match public market alternatives. After adjusting for the higher level
of risk and the greater degree of illiquidity in buyout transactions, publicly traded equity
securities gain a clear advantage.
Performance and Buyout Funds
In the private equity world, active management success goes hand-in-glove with investment
success. In asset classes such as domestic equity and fixed income, which contain passive
investment alternatives, investors can buy the market. By owning a marketable security index
fund, investors reap market returns in a cost-efficient, reliable manner. In the inefficient private
equity world, investors cannot buy the market, as no investable index exists. Even if a leveraged
buyout index existed, based on past performance, index-like results would fail to satisfy investor
desires for superior risk-adjusted returns. In fact, only top-quartile or top-decile funds produce
returns sufficient to compensate for private equity's greater illiquidity and higher risk. In the
absence of truly superior fund selection skills (or extraordinary luck), investors should stay far,
far away from private equity investments.
Consider two decades of buyout partnership returns. For funds formed beginning in 1985,
limited partners received a disappointing 7.3 percent median return. In contrast, the S&P 500
delivered 11.9 percent returns. First quartile buyout results reach double digits with a 16.1
percent per annum result, while third quartile performance falls into negative territory at -1.4
percent per annum. The median buyout result compares unfavorably to the marketable
security alternative which produced higher returns with less risk. 13
Academic research backs up the notion that private equity produces generally mediocre
results. Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and
Antoinette Schoar of the Sloan School of Management at MIT, in an August 2005 study on
private equity performance, conclude that "LBO fund returns net of fees are slightly less than
those of the S&P 500."14 The study covers the period from 1980 to 2001. Kaplan and Schour's
results should dismay prospective private equity investors. Because the authors make no
adjustment for leverage, the failure of LBO funds to match stock market returns adds the
insult of higher risk to the injury of poor performance.
Investors in buyout partnerships received miserable risk-adjusted returns over the past two
decades. Since the only material differences between privately owned buyouts and publicly
traded companies lic in the nature of ownership (private vs. public) and character of capital
structure (highly leveraged vs. less highly leveraged), comparing buyout returns to public
market returns makes sense as a starting point. But, because the riskier, more-leveraged buyout
positions ought to generate higher returns, sensible investors recoil at the buyout industry's
deficit relative to public market alternatives. On a risk-adjusted basis, marketable equities win
in a landslide.
A Yale Investments Office study provides insight into the additional return required to
compensate for the risk in leveraged buyout transactions. Examination of 542 buyout deals
initiated and concluded between 1987 and 1998 showed gross returns of 48 percent per
annum, significantly above the 17 percent return that would have resulted from comparably
timed and comparably sized investments in the S&P 500. On the surface, buyouts beat stocks
by a wide margin. Adjustment for management fees and general partners' profit participation
bring the estimated buyout result to 36 percent per year, still comfortably ahead of the
marketable security alternative. Note the extreme positive bias of the buyout sample. Long-
term studies show that median buyout returns fall in the neighborhood of those produced by
the S&P 500. In the sample of deals presented to Yale, buy-outs crush marketable securities. XII
Because buyout transactions by their very nature involve higher-than-market levels of
leverage, the basic buyout-fund-to-marketable-security comparison fails the apples-to-apples
standard. To produce a risk-neutral comparison, consider the impact of applying leverage to
public market investments. Comparably timed, comparably sized, and comparably leveraged
investments in the S&P 500 produced an astonishing 86 percent annual return. The risk-
adjusted marketable security result exceeded the buyout result of 36 percent per year by an
astounding 50 percentage points per year.
Some part of the failure of buyout managers to produce attractive risk-adjusted returns
stems from an inappropriate fee structure. Buyout investors generally pay 20 percent of profits
to the investment firm's partners. Because the incentive compensation fails to consider the
investor's cost of capital, buyout partnerships capture 20 percent of returns generated by the
favorable wind at the long-term equity investor's back. Of course, in the case of transactions
that employ greater-than-market levels of leverage, the investor's cost of capital increases along
with the degree of leverage. Pure financial engineering represents a commodity, easily available
to marketable securities investors through margin accounts and futures markets. Buyout
managers deserve scant incremental compensation for adding debt to corporate balance sheets.
By paying buyout partnership sponsors 20 percent of all gains, the fund investors compensate
the fund managers with a significant portion of leveraged market gains over which the fund
manager exercises no control and for which the fund managers deserves no credit. The large
majority of buyout funds fail to add sufficient value to overcome a grossly unreasonable fee
structure.
Another part of the industry-wide problem of poor returns relates to misalignment of
incentives in large funds. Buyout firms generally begin with modest amounts of assets under
management, totaling in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Management fees cover overhead
and incentive fees reward superior performance. Successful buyout funds almost invariably
increase fund size, for example, moving from $250 million for Fund I to $500 million for Fund
II to $1 billion for Fund III to $2 billion for Fund IV and ever more for funds of increasing
numerals. As fund size increases, management fees as a percentage of assets remain relatively
constant, resulting in a dramatic increase in the dollar value of fee income. The change in
compensation structure alters general partner motivation.
The partners of newer, smaller funds focus predominantly on generating investment
returns. Since modest levels of fees cover reasonable operating expenses, strong investment
returns define the only path to wealth. Not only do superior returns lead to large profits
interests, strong results allow the general partners to raise subsequent, ever larger funds.
Eventually, as fund size increases, fee income becomes an increasingly significant profit
center. As fee income grows, general partner behavior changes, focusing on protecting the
firm's franchise and maintaining the annuity-like character of the stream of fees. Larger buyout
funds pursue less risky deals, employing lower levels of leverage. Mega funds often exploit their
franchises by expanding into other (fee-generating) lines of business, including real estate, fixed
income, and hedge fund management. The big partnerships devote more time to cultivating
and nourishing limited partner relationships, the source of the funds (and fees). Less time
remains for investment activity. Returns suffer.
Past return data provide dramatic support for the notion that larger funds produce inferior
results. For the ten years ending December 31, 2005, buyout funds with more than $1 billion
of committed capital produced returns of 9.3 percent per year, falling short of both the overall
buyout industry return of 9.7 percent per year and the $500 million to $1 billion cohort return
of 10.3 percent. Buyouts in the range of $250 million to $500 million performed even better,
posting results of 11.4 percent per annum.15 Large size correlates with
returns.
Academic work supports the negative relationship between size and performance. Josh
Lerner of Harvard Business School and Antoinette Schoar of MIT's Sloan School found "a
strong relationship between fund growth and returns-the more dramatic the increase
between two funds, the sharper the decline in return between the funds."16 Increases in fund
size benefit the general partner at the limited partners' expense.
Casual observers might draw the superficial conclusion that the key to success in buyout
investing involves concentrating on smaller buyout funds. While smaller funds undoubtedly
offer greater alignment of interests between the general partners and the passive providers of
funds, a policy of simply choosing to invest in smaller funds may not lead to satisfactory
results.
First, after adjusting the returns of smaller buyout funds to account for higher levels of risk,
excess returns may disappear. Smaller buyout funds invest in smaller companics, which
necessarily carry higher levels of operational risk. Adding greater operational risk to higher
financial risk creates a substantial risk-adjusted hurdle for the small-company-buyout investor.
Investors must receive material compensation for the heightened risk and additional illiquidity
in small company buyout investing.
Second, an investor backing smaller buyout funds solely based on historical performance
makes the mistake of investing while looking through the rearview mirror. Superior absolute, if
not risk-adjusted, returns attract flows of capital. As market participants conclude that small
buyouts outperform large buyouts, the market responds by creating large numbers of
partnerships devoted to pursuing middle-market buyout transactions. Any excess returns that
may have existed will be threatened by the influx of new capital and new participants. Be wary
of the market's ability to eliminate sources of superior risk-adjusted returns.
Yale's Experience Yale's buyout portfolio returns provide a ray of hope to investors secking
risk-adjusted excess returns. The university attempts to invest only with firms that place central
importance on enhancing the effectiveness of corporate operations. Company building
strategies permit buyout fund managers to add value beyond the increase in returns expected
from adopting higher risk capital structures. By identifying managers that implement
operationally oriented strategies, Yale creates the possibility of winning in a tough arena.
Consider the data in the study of buyout transactions presented to Yale between 1987 and
1998, as shown in Table 8.1. Yale participated in 118 of 542 transactions in the sample,
generating gross returns of 63 percent relative to a risk equivalent benchmark of 41 percent. If
the risk adjustment appropriately captures the return expected from financial engineering, the
premium return earned by Yale represents value added by the fund manager. Even though fund
manager fees take an estimated 15 percentage points of annual return, the university's net
returns of 48 percent still comfortably exceed the risk-adjusted marketable securities bogey.
Yale's buyout results rely far less on leverage than do the results of the broad pool of buyout
transactions. Contrast the broad pool's nearly 70 percentage point difference between the
unlevered S&P return and the risk-adjusted benchmark with Yale's 21 percentage point
difference. Less reliance on leverage and more attention to operations lead to superior risk-
adjusted results. By employing an approach that emphasizes operating improvements and
employs lower leverage, Yale's buyout portfolio manages to produce handsome absolute and
risk-adjusted returns.

Active Management
No sensible investor manages private assets passively. Even if participation in a broadly
diversified market alternative were available, investors would face nearly certain
disappointment. Burdened by staggering fees and characterized by well above marketable
equity risk levels, a broad collection of private funds would likely produce returns far from
sufficient to compensate for the risk incurred. Investors justify the inclusion of private equity
in portfolios only by selecting top quality managers pursuing value-added strategies with
appropriate deal structures.
Due Diligence The character of a private equity fund's investment principals constitutes the
single most important criterion in evaluating the merits of an investment. Driven, intelligent,
ethical individuals operating in a cohesive partnership possess an edge likely to translate into
superior investment results. On the other end of the spectrum, individuals willing to cut
corners, operationally, intellectually, or ethically, place an investor's funds and reputation at
risk.
The central importance of choosing strong investment partners places enormous weight on
the due diligence process. Concluding that a private equity firm consists of credible,
professionally qualified individuals in pursuit of interesting investment opportunities serves
merely as a starting point. Before making a commitment, careful investors determine that the
fund's principals exhibit the characteristics necessary to justify entrusting institutional assets to
their care. Because of the long-term nature of private equity contracts, investors ultimately rely
on the good faith of fund managers to behave in the best interests of the limited partners.
While negotiating appropriate deal terms remains important, contractual arrangements almost
invariably fail to deal with all of the important issues that ultimately arise in the general
partner/limited partner relationship. Good people can overcome bad contracts, but good
contracts cannot overcome bad people.
Comprehensive due diligence requires substantial effort. Personal and professional
references provided by prospective fund managers provide an initial set of contacts. Because of
the inevitable selection bias in a hand-picked reference list, sensible investors seek candid,
confidential assessments from other individuals, including both business colleagues and
personal acquaintances. Over time, investors develop networks that facilitate reference
checking and increase the quality of decision making. Careful investors make skeptical calls,
actively looking for potential issues. Going through the motions by conducting superficial
checks adds nothing to the due diligence process.
Careful investors evaluate the fund manager's investment operation by spending sufficient
time at the firm's offices to assess the character of the workplace. Firms exhibit distinct
personalities that influence the quality of operations in fundamental ways, suggesting that
investors favor those groups deemed a good personality fit. Spending time in informal, social
settings further enhances the information set used to evaluate the decision makers. Selecting
individuals driven to produce superior results in a high quality manner constitutes the central
challenge of manager selection.
In spite of the enormous importance of conducting thorough due diligence, many investors
fail to devote the time and energy necessary to make well-informed judgments. In 1999, one of
the principals of a $2 billion buyout fund reported that only one investor took the time to meet
the firm's full team before committing funds. By foregoing the opportunity to assess the
quality of an investment operation's personnel, prospective investors fail to execute the most
important task.
Long-Term Commitments Private investment addresses Keynes's notion that the job of
investment might be done better if decisions were "permanent and indissoluble, like marriage,
except by reason of death or other grave cause..."17 While falling somewhat short of the
gravity of the decision to marry, funding a private equity firm represents a long-term
commitment. In contrast to the termination of a marketable securities manager where the
vestiges of any relationship quickly disappear, evidence from terminated private investment
funds remains on the books for years to come. Knowledge that private investment decisions
represent long-term commitments forces sensible investors to establish high hurdles for
initiating investment relationships.
The illiquid nature of private investing allows private equity managers to make the longer
term decisions necessary to pursue successful investment strategies. Marketable securities
managers know that clients possess little patience for performance shortfall, pulling the trigger
quickly when the numbers fail to meet expectations. As a result, stock jockeys learn to
overdiversify portfolios, holding small positions in securities selected as much to avoid
disappointment as to generate exciting returns. In contrast, private fund managers "lock in"
assets for long periods of time, with partnership terms that often span a decade or more. While
the typical fundraising cycle of two to three years might pressure managers to shorten
investment time frames, investors frequently accept the argument that "it's too early to judge
the most recent fund," allowing private asset managers to make truly long-term decisions.
In fact, when evaluating private funds, investors face little choice but to focus on changes in
corporate operations, not minute-by-minute fluctuations in market value. By emphasizing an
investment's intrinsic valuc, investors assess factors under the manager's control, liberating
private fund managers from the frequently fickle judgments of the equity markets and
allowing pursuit of sensible investment strategies.
Strong private equity groups use the long investment horizon to pursue strategies that add
substantial value to corporate activities. Fund managers providing only capital operate at a
competitive disadvantage to groups that improve company operations in a fundamental way.
In the leveraged buyout arena, supplying money to purchase a well-run company constitutes a
commodity, as all major investment funds boast the financial skills necessary to complete plain
vanilla transactions. Low barriers to entry allow former investment bankers to respond to mid-
career crises by abandoning the life of an agent and embracing the glories of an investment
principal, flooding the market with capital to pursue "clean" deals. In contrast, buyout firms
that demonstrate the ability to deal with substantial operating issues carve out a special
transactional niche, creating the potential for less competitive, proprietary deal flow. The
combination of less competition for operationally oriented transactions and potential benefits
from addressing operational issues provides a compelling investment opportunity.
Clayton, Dubilier & Rice and WESCO Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CDR), a firm with a long
distinguished track record, focuses its efforts on "messy" deals-transactions that require a
high degree of intervention by the principals. The firm implements its value-added investment
strategy by bringing individuals with operating backgrounds into the partnership. These
partners provide valuable perspective during the due diligence process, identifying acquisition
candidates that might benefit from the firm's unusual skills. Once CDR acquires a company,
operating partners take a "hands on" approach to improving corporate operations. One
subclass of transactions that CDR pursues involves corporate divestitures. Frequently, the
divested subsidiary lacks basic corporate organizational structure, having relied on the parent
company to provide a variety of essential business services. Value creation results as CDR uses
its combination of operational and financial expertise to create a stand-alone company from
the erstwhile corporate division.
In February 1993, CDR principals began evaluating a spin-off of WESCO, Westinghouse's
electrical equipment and supplies distribution arm. Within a short time, the buyout firm
identified several major business issues: (1) transition from corporate subsidiary to a market-
driven business; (2) improvement of inventory and logistics management; and (3) reduction of
corporate overhead. More than one-half of WESCO's 250 branches posted losses in 1993,
contributing to firm-wide red ink totaling more than $3 million on a revenue base of $1.6
billion.
On top of material business issues, WESCO suffered from sleepy management that let the
company drift. The company required a more aggressive team to instill a sense of corporate
mission, repair damaged morale, and improve lackluster performance.
After Westinghouse rejected CDR's initial bid as inadequate, the firm continued to work
on the project. Operating partner Chuck Ames drove the process, identifying a management
plan and preparing to run the company, if necessary. By February 1994, when Westinghouse
came back to CDR, Ames had identified a chief executive, Roy Haley, with the ability to create
and manage the new company.
When CDR acquired WESCO for $330 million, the company lacked basic corporate
infrastructure. Creating information technology, finance, and internal control divisions from
scratch provided the basic building blocks necessary for corporate existence. Implementing the
operating plan crafted prior to acquisition created substantial additional value, moving the
company from losses to meaningful profits.
By 1997, when a financial buyer purchased WESCO, the firm generated $90 million of
operating income on $2.7 billion of revenue. The turnaround in performance produced great
results for CDR. The buyout firm's original $83 million of equity generated proceeds of $511
million, providing annual returns of nearly 47 percent to the firm's limited partners. The
extraordinary results stem from one measure of financial engineering and several measures of
operating improvement.
Few firms possess the skill set required to address the severe operating problems and
company building challenges found at WESCO. By combining operational and financial skills,
CDR exemplifies the potential for unusual value creation.
Buyouts and Inflation
Because buyout valuations correlate strongly with marketable equity valuations, buyouts tend
to exhibit the poor short-term inflation hedging characteristics typical of marketable equities.
That said, since a buyout's more highly leveraged balance sheet contains substantial levels of
fixed rate liabilities, which lose value in an environment of unanticipated inflation, buyouts
may perform somewhat better than less levered companies in an inflationary period.
Alignment of Interests
Investors in buyout funds benefit from structural forces that serve to align the interests of
corporate management and providers of capital. High degrees of balance sheet leverage force
company managers to manage assets efficiently, with energies focused on generating cash flows
to satisfy debt service obligations. The lure of shareholder-unfriendly corporate perquisites
pales in comparison to the specter of default and the grail of profit participation. Buyout
transactions serve to align interests of managers and investors.
Unfortunately, investors in buyout partnerships face the same set of issues that confront
investors in any scheme where the sponsor receives a profits interest. Profit-sharing
arrangements create options that may lead to behavior that benefits the fund operator and
disadvantages the provider of funds. To offset the optionality of the profits interest, substantial
levels of co-investment by the sponsor of the buyout partnership create a symmetry regarding
gains and losses that goes a long way toward keeping interests aligned.
In the ideal world, management fees cover reasonable firm overhead while profits interests
provide attractive incentive compensation. In the real world, excessive management fees, a
particularly acute problem for larger buyout funds, drive a wedge between the interests of the
general partners and the limited partners. Deal fees, which many funds charge upon successful
consummation of a transaction, represent an egregious means by which fund managers enrich
themselves at the expense of their capital-contributing partners. The rationale for deal fees
mystifies thoughtful investors. Since investors pay management fees to compensate the fund
managers for day-to-day work on the fund, what role do transaction fees play? Monitoring fees
represent a similarly superfluous charge. Why do buyout firms assess a fee for monitoring
investments when they already collect a more than adequate management fee? In fact, buyout
funds, particularly large funds that produce fees of hundreds of millions of dollars, represent
an unfortunate example of misalignment of interests between fund managers and investors.
Academic research on fees gives buyout investors pause. Using data on terms for 144
buyout funds formed between 1992 and 2006, Andrew Metrick and Ayako Yasuda of the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School estimate that the present value of fees consumes
an average of nearly $20 of every $100 under management. Little wonder that limited partners
so often fail to achieve reasonable returns!
The researchers examine the absolute level and relative size of fixed revenues (management
fees and entry transaction fees) and variable revenues (carried interest, monitoring fees, and exit
transaction fees). The mix between fixed revenues, which buyout mavens pocket simply for
showing up, and variable revenues, which depend on investment performance, further
discourages thoughtful investors. Fully 62 percent of revenues come from fixed fees, leaving
only 38 percent to reward performance. In fact, a portion of fees classified as variable by
Metrick and Yasuda, namely monitoring fees and the exit transaction fee (on the amount for
the original investment), accrue to the general partner in the instance of no investment
performance, painting a dismal picture indeed.18
Market Characteristics
At December 31, 2006, the U.S. leveraged buyout industry controlled approximately $342
billion in capital, of which approximately 57 percent was invested in companies with the
remainder committed by investors, but undrawn. More than 360 buyout partnerships were
active in the United States at the end of 2006.19
Summary
Buyout funds constitute a poor investment for casual investors. The underlying company
investments in buyout funds differ from their public market counterparts only in degree of
balance sheet risk and liquidity. The higher debt and lower liquidity of buyout deals demand
higher compensation in the form of superior returns to investors. Unfortunately for private
equity investors, in recent decades buyout funds delivered lower returns than comparable
marketable securities positions, even before adjusting for risk.
Fees create a hurdle that proves extremely difficult for buyout investors to clear. Aside from
substantial year-to-year management fees, buyout funds command a significant share of deal
profits, usually equal to one-fifth of the total. On top of the management fee and incentive
compensation, buyout managers typically charge deal fees and often charge monitoring fees.
The cornucopia of compensation ensures a feast for the buyout manager, while the buyout
investor hopes at best for a hearty serving of leftovers.
As with other forms of investment that depend on superior active management, sensible
investors look at buyout partnerships with a high degree of skepticism. Unless investors
identify top-quartile, or even top-decile managers, results almost certainly fail to compensate
for the degree of risk incurred.
Venture Capital
Venture capital partnerships provide financing and company building skills to start-up
operations with the goal of developing companies into substantial, profitable enterprises.
Providers of funds to venture capital partnerships respond to multiple sources of attraction:
driving an important element of the capitalist system, savoring the glitz surrounding the
celebrity of the venture capital industry, and garnering a share of the gains generated by
entrepreneurial activity.
Part of the attraction of venture capital investing lies in the option-like character of
individual investments. Downside losses cannot exceed the amount invested. Upside gains can
multiply the original stake many fold. The combination of limited downside and substantial
upside produces an investor-friendly, positively skewed distribution of outcomes.
Unfortunately for investors, the promise of venture capital exceeds the reality. Over
reasonably long periods of time, aggregate venture returns more or less match marketable
equity returns, indicating that providers of capital fail to receive compensation for the
substantial risks inherent in start-up investing.
Aside from the dismal picture provided by historical experience, all but the most
longstanding investors in venture partnerships face a problem in adverse selection. The highest
quality, top-tier venture firms generally refuse to accept new investors and ration capacity even
among existing providers of funds. Venture firms willing and able to accept money from new
sources frequently represent relatively unattractive, second-tier (or worse) investment
opportunities.
Prior to the technology bubble of the late 1990s, investors in venture partnerships received
returns inadequate to compensate for the risks incurred. In a few glorious years, the Internet
mania allowed venture investors to share in a staggering flood of riches. Yet the bubble-induced
enthusiasm for private technology investing produced an unanticipated problem for venture
investors. Indiscriminate demand allowed the managing partners of venture funds to increase
the flow of management fees and take a greater share of profits. After the post-bubble collapse,
venture capital partnerships maintained their newly fashioned investor-unfriendly terms,
creating an even higher hurdle for investment success.
Although investing in venture capital partnerships promises participation in the substance
and glamor of backing start-up enterprises, investors providing capital to the venture industry
receive returns inadequate to compensate for the high degree of risk. Only if investors generate
top-quartile, or even top-decile, results do returns suffice to compensate for the risks incurred.
The Glamorous Appeal of Venture Capital
In September 1995, Pierre Omidyar, a French-born Iranian immigrant, started an online
auction site, ostensibly to help his girlfriend sell her collection of Pez dispensers. Even though
by late 1996, the business expanded nicely and produced solid profits, the company's founder
decided to seek outside assistance. Two years after the humble beginnings of the company now
named eBay, Omidyar invited venture capital provider Benchmark Capital to make an
investment and join the board. The then-recently-formed Silicon Valley venture firm made a
$6.7 million investment in Omidyar's eBay, valuing the company at $20 million.
After Benchmark's investment, eBay's growth continued apace, fueled by the engagement
of a new management team headed by the impressive Meg Whitman. The company soon
proved ready for prime-time, as the September 1998 launch of eBay's initial public offering
powered the company's valuation to $700 million. The IPO pricing proved fleeting, as investor
interest drove the first day's price from the offering level of $18 per share to $47 per share,
representing the "fifth-highest first-day gain in the market's history."20 At the close of trading
on September 23, 1998 the market valued eBay at more than $2 billion. Benchmark's $6.7
million investment exploded to more than $400 million, a breathtaking sixty-fold increase in a
little more than a year.
The eBay rocket ship had barely begun its journey. In April 1999, with the stock trading at
$175 per share, the company's market value totaled in excess of $21 billion. Looking to lock in
some of the firm's extraordinary gains, Benchmark Capital distributed a portion of its position
to the limited partners. With Benchmark's $6.7 million investment worth $6.7 billion, the
investment multiple of 1,000 times qualified eBay as "the Valley's best-performing venture
investment ever."21
Far from a flash in the pan, eBay continued to mature, becoming a standard-bearer among
Internet companies. On July 22, 2002, boasting a market capitalization of $15.7 billion, eBay
Joined the ranks of the S&P 500, taking the 104th place, just ahead of the venerable BB&T
Corporation, a North Carolina based financial services concern with a storied past that dated
to the Civil War. On the last day of trading in 2007, eBay's valuation stood at $45 billion,
representing a 2,250 multiple of the valuation assigned to the firm by Benchmark Capital's
original investment.
Everyone made money. Pierre Omidyar, eBay's founder, created wealth beyond
imagination. Meg Whitman, along with the rest of eBay's management and employees,
received a huge payday. Venture capitalists and their financial backers posted staggering
investment gains. Even public shareholders generated significant holding period returns.
Venture capital ruled.
Although eBay stands apart, the venture capital world's other successes, companies such as
Cisco, Genentech, Amazon.com, Starbucks, and Intel, produced enormous gains for
entrepreneurs and investors alike. Even start-ups that ultimately failed, such as @home and
Excite.com, provided opportunities for financial backers to profit as company valuations soared
to multi-billion-dollar levels, before plummeting back to earth.
The Harsh Reality of Venture Capital Performance
Unfortunately for investors, gains from high profile venture-backed successes prove insufficient
to produce acceptable returns on an industry-wide basis. Over long periods of time, venture
investors receive no more than market-like returns with demonstrably higher levels of risk. The
promise of venture capital fails to deliver.
Venture capital partnerships produced a surprisingly low median return of 3.1 percent for
the twenty years beginning in 1985. In contrast, the S&P 500 returned 11.9 percent per
annum. Venture results exhibited a wide dispersion, ranging from 721 percent to -100 percent,
with a standard deviation of 51.1 percent. First quartile results of 16.9 percent provided much
better than median results, while third quartile returns of -6.7 percent significantly impaired
investor capital.22
Venture capital returns proved disappointing, even when measured at the peak of one of the
greatest speculative manias. The 2001 Investment Benchmarks Report reported that a sample of
nearly 950 venture capital funds produced a 19.6 percent rate of return for the twenty-year
period ending December 31, 2000. In absolute terms, the nearly 20 percent per year over
twenty years appears handsome indeed.
Consider, however, if instead of making venture capital investments, investors made
equivalent investments, in timing and in size, in the S&P 500. The marketable security result of
20.2 percent per annum outpaces the composite venture capital return. Even at the point of
maximum return for venture capital, investors in plain-old-large-capitalization common stocks
enjoyed higher returns with lower risks.
Aside from the intuitive conclusion that investors in privately held start-up companies face
materially higher risk than investors in publicly traded large-capitalization corporations, more
rigorous definition of the risk differential proves difficult. Suffice it to say that venture investors
must achieve top-quartile or top-decile results to begin to argue that they achieved superior
risk-adjusted returns.
Franchise Firms
Atop the hierarchy of venture capital partnerships stand a relatively small number of venture
firms that occupy an extraordinary position. This group of eight or ten firms enjoys a
substantial edge over less-exalted practitioners. Top-tier venture capitalists benefit from
extraordinary deal flow, a stronger negotiating position, and superior access to capital markets.
In short, participants in the venture capital process, from the entrepreneur to the investment
banker, prefer dealing with this small set of franchise firms.
In no other area of the capital markets does the identity of the source of funds matter in the
way that it does in the venture capital world. Consider the bond markets. Do the issuers of
government or corporate debt care about the identity of the bondholders? Consider the equity
markets. Do the managements of publicly traded companies care about the identity of the
stockholders? While in certain unusual circumstances, such as in a contested change in
corporate control, issuers of securities may care about the identity of their holders, generally
the name, rank, and serial number of security owners prove of little interest to security issuers.
Consider the real assets markets. Do managers of office buildings, operators of oil wells, or
caretakers of timberlands care about the identity of the owners? Overwhelmingly, the source of
funds for investment purchases matters little or nothing to the individuals responsible for
managing assets.
In contrast, managers of venture-capital-backed enterprises care enormously about the
source of funds. A disproportionate share of entrepreneurs secking start-up financing seek out
venture firms with strong franchises, in the belief that funding from a top-tier firm increases
the odds of ultimate success. General partners of franchise venture firms constitute a truly
extraordinary group, bringing exceptional judgment and unequaled company-building skills to
the board table. Start-up firms benefit from the franchise venture capitalists' accumulated
wisdom, well-established connections, and hard-won investment insights. Thoughtful
entrepreneurs often willingly and knowingly accept a discounted valuation to cement a deal
with a venture capitalist of choice. The reputation of the venture capital elite creates a virtuous
circle in which investment success begets investment success.
Academic research supports the notion of franchise firm performance persistence in the
venture capital arena. Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business
and Antoinette Schoar of MIT's Sloan School of Management find substantial persistence of
fund performance, suggesting that "Igleneral partners whose funds outperform the industry in
one fund are likely to outperform in the next and vice versa." The authors note that their
"findings are markedly different from the results for mutual funds, where persistence has been
difficult to detect. "23 While Kaplan and Schoar identify some persistence in buyout returns,
they find "a statistically and economically strong amount of persistence" particularly in venture
funds.24
Recent entrants to the arena of venture investing, as well as longer-term players with run-of-
the-mill portfolios, face a challenge unique to the venture industry. All of the top-tier venture
capital partnerships limit assets under management and none of the top-tier partnerships
currently accept new investors. Consequently, outsiders remain outside, limiting the available
set of choices for new investors hoping to enter and existing investors hoping to upgrade.
New participants in the venture market must consider the return prospects of venture firms
available for new-money investment. Obviously, industry-wide returns suffer with the removal
of the records of relatively longstanding, relatively large, relatively high performing funds. Since
the available opportunities for the overwhelming number of investors exclude the top-tier
venture firms, return expectations require a commensurate downward adjustment. In the
context of an industry that historically produced returns similar to marketable equity returns,
even a moderate downward adjustment spells trouble. The inability to access the venture clite
drives the final nail in the coffin of prospective venture investor aspirations.
Venture Capital and Inflation
As with any corporate entity, the venture capital investor's claim on the nominal value of
company assets ought to provide a positive correlation to inflation. As with other assets that
exhibit some link to marketable equity prices, the poor short-term relationship between
marketable equities and inflation calls into question the inflation-hedging ability of venture
capital.
Alignment of Interests
Venture funds share with buyout funds and hedge funds the incentive compensation scheme
that creates option-like payoffs for the general partner. A high level of co-investment by the
general partner represents a sure way to align investor interests, creating a salutary symmetry in
general partners' attitudes toward gains and losses. Unfortunately, in the broader venture
world, significant general partner co-investment represents the exception, not the rule.
Interestingly, however, a fair number of the venture capital elite invest substantial amounts of
personal funds side-by-side with their limited partners.
Investment success allows fund sponsors to move the terms of trade in the general partners'
favor. The technology bubble of the late 1990s provides a case in point. Inspired by enormous
investor demand, venture firms raised bubble-cra funds in the neighborhood of ten times the
size of funds raised only a decade earlier, moving from a typical 1990-vintage fund size of $100
million to $150 million to a 2000-vintage fund size of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. Along with the
increase in fund size came an increase in fee income that far out-paced the growth in the size of
the professional staff. The dramatic rise in asset-based income transformed fees from an
overhead recovery mechanism to a partnership profit center.
More distressing to limited partners, venture partnerships used the huge increase in investor
interest in all things technological to extract a greater share of fund profits. Prior to the
technology mania, venture firms operated in a well-defined hierarchy that gave most firms a 20
percent share of profits, a handful of demonstrably superior firms a 25 percent share of profits,
and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers-the dean of the industry-a 30 percent share of profits.
Elite firms double dipped by creating larger profits and keeping a greater share.
During the Internet bubble, greed prevailed. Seemingly limitless demand for venture capital
investments allowed the rank and file to move their profits interest from 20 percent to 25
percent and the superior firms to move from 25 percent to 30 percent. In an extraordinary act
of selflessness and generosity, Kleiner Perkins, which could have moved its share of profits to 40
percent or even 50 percent, kept its profit share at 30 percent. The general partners of Kleiner
Perkins, while acutely aware of their market power, no doubt decided to leave the firm's profit
share at 30 percent to benefit the institutional missions of the firm's endowment and
foundation investors.
Faced with an opportunity to skew deal terms in the general partner's favor, in spite of the
industry's mediocre record of adding value, venture capitalists reacted with aplomb. In the
aftermath of the bubble, a number of firms reduced fund sizes to more rational levels,
mitigating the negative impact of excessive fees, but instances of funds reducing the profits
interest have yet to come to light. In spite of dismal post-mania venture investment
performance, the ratchet in profits interest appears to work in one direction only.
Market Characteristics
At December 31, 2006, the U.S. venture capital industry controlled approximately $131 billion
in capital, of which approximately 62 percent was invested in companies, with the remainder
committed by investors, but undrawn. More than 870 venture partnerships were active in the
United States at the end of 2006.25
Summary
Venture capital investments appeal to a wide range of market participants motivated by the
prospects of participating in a fundamental driver of the capitalist system, reveling in the
glamor of high profile start-up successes and benefiting from outsized investment returns. As
illustrated by the case of eBay, venture investing sometimes produces truly breathtaking results.
Unfortunately, eBay's corporate achievements and stock market success stand far apart from
the usual venture investment results. In aggregate, venture investors fare about as well as their
marketable equity counterparts. After adjustment for risk, the overwhelming majority of
venture capital fails to produce acceptable risk-adjusted returns.
The new entrant to the world of private entrepreneurial finance faces an obstacle quite
apart from the barriers hampering investment success in other asset classes. The top tier of
venture partnerships, essentially closed to new money, enjoy superior access to deals,
entrepreneurs, and capital markets. Exclusion from the venture capital clite disadvantages all
but the most longstanding, most successful limited partners.
CONCLUSION
Nontraditional asset classes provide powerful tools for investors who seek to reduce risk by
constructing well-diversified portfolios and to augment returns by pursuing profitable active
management opportunities. Absolute return strategies and real assets holdings add diversifying
power, while private equity investments enhance portfolio return prospects.
Absolute return investments consist of event-driven and value-driven strategies that exploit
mispricings in marketable securities. By offsetting market exposure with hedges, investors
reduce systematic risk and cause results to depend on manager skill. Event-driven positions rely
on evaluation of events associated with corporate mergers and bankruptcies, while value-driven
positions depend on identification of misvalued securities. Because absolute return strategies
generate equity-like returns largely independent of market movements, the asset class
contributes extremely attractive return and diversification characteristics to portfolios.
Yale pioneered the use of absolute return as an asset class, first employing it in 1990. As of
June 30, 2007, inception-to-date returns clocked in at 13.2 percent per annum, with a standard
deviation of only 4.9 percent (relative to the Wilshire 5000's 11.2 percent return and 14.0
percent standard deviation). Absolute return fulfilled its mission of producing uncorr ted
returns, showing monthly correlations of an identical 0.02 with both stocks and bonds.
Real assets protect investment portfolios against unanticipated increases in inflation, with
investors paying a price for real assets' diversifying power by accepting expected returns below
those of marketable equities. Under normal circumstances, high levels of current cash flow
provide a stabilizing influence, reducing the volatility of portfolio fluctuations. From both a
risk and a return perspective, Yale's real assets portfolio succeeded, posting a 17.8 percent per
annum return from inception in July 1978 to June 2007.
Private equity positions enhance portfolio returns at the price of meaningfully increasing
portfolio risk, while producing little in terms of diversifying power. Investor experience over
the past two decades failed to live up to expectations, as funds generally delivered below
marketable equity returns at above marketable equity risk levels. Burdened by extraordinary
fees in the form of substantial profit-sharing arrangements, investors face the difficult task of
selecting top decile funds to realize the promise of private investing,
Strong alignment of interests marks most private equity arrangements, creating an
appropriate set of incentives for fund managers. Significant co-investment by partners of
buyout and venture funds moves investment decisions toward a principal orientation and away
from a potentially damaging agency perspective. Side-by-side commitment of general partners
dollars causes all parties to share in the gains and losses, forcing decision makers to consider the
downside-as well as the upside-of corporate actions. The show of confidence inherent in a
significant general partner co-investment sends a strong signal to potential investors.
Strategies for adding value to corporate operations make private equity an interesting
investment activity, creating the possibility of exploiting less competitive deal-sourcing
environments and identifying operations-enhancing opportunities. To the extent that private
asset managers increase corporate value in a substantial way, investment results exhibit
independence from the forces that drive valuation of marketable equities. Only by adding
significant increments of value do private fund managers begin to earn the extraordinary fees
associated with private equity deals. Strong active management-at the investor level, the fund
level, and the company level-forms the basis for successful private equity programs.
By selecting high quality partnerships that pursue value-adding strategies, Yale University
achieved rates of return in excess of 30 percent per annum on private equity investments over
the thirty years from 1978 to 2007, highlighting the potential contribution to portfolio results
from a well-managed private equity program. Even after adjusting for the higher risk inherent
in venture capital and leveraged buyout participations, Yale's results stack up well relative to
other investment alternatives.
Successful investors in nontraditional asset classes engage in active management, seeking to
identify the highest quality people to manage investment funds. In selecting partners, due
diligence efforts center on assessing the competence and character of the individuals
responsible for portfolio decisions. Developing partnerships with extraordinary people
represents the single most important element of alternative investment success.
I. Absolute return strategies that employ offsetting long and short positions (merger arbitrage and long/short
investing) earn money market returns in the absence of manager value added (or subtracted). On one side of the
portfolio, assume a manager invests contributed funds in long positions. On the other side of the portfolio, assume a
manager executes a short sale. Upon consummating a short sale, the manager receives cash proceeds from the
transaction. Even though the cash must be posted as collateral with the lender of the security, the short seller earns a
"rebate," or money market rate, on the proceeds. If the long position and short position both track the market
precisely, gains (lasses) from the long match losses (gains) from the short, eliminating the systematic market factors
from performance. Under such circumstances, the investor earns the money market like short rebate on invested assets.
II. The story of Farallon Capital Management's handling of the MCI Communications/World Com combination
appears in Harvard Business Case N9-299.020, "Farallon Capital Management: Risk Arbitrage," written by Robert
Howard and Andre Perold in February 1999. The case study describes the ultimately successful efforts of Tom Steyer,
David Cohen, and Bill Duhamel in navigating the complexities of an extraordinary merger transaction.
III. Russell/Mellon Analytical Services produces the manager data used in this section. The Russell 3000 provides the
passive benchmark employed to measure relative performance.
IV. Begin with a gross return of 8.9 percent. Subtract the 1.0 percent management fee, leaving a 7.9 percent return.
Take a 20 percent profits interest (0.2 x 7.9= 1.6) from the remaining return, producing a 6.3 percent net result.
V. The Sharpe ratio, a measure of excess return generated per unit of risk, for Yale's absolute return portfolio amounted
to 1.8 over its seventeen year life. In contrast, passive investments in domestic equities and fixed income posted Sharpe
ratios of 0.9 and 0.7, respectively, over equivalent periods.9
Asset Class Management
Active managers compete in an extremely tough arena, since markets tend to price assets
accurately. Enormous sums of money deployed by highly motivated investors seck to exploit
perceived mispricings at a moment's notice. Winning at the game of active management
requires great skill and, perhaps, more than a little good fortune. Serious investors consider
carefully the certain results of low cost passive management before opting for the uncertain
returns of high cost active management.
Significant costs raise the hurdle for active strategies. Identifying a portfolio that merely
beats the market fails to define success, as managers must build portfolios that beat the market
by a sufficient margin to cover management fees, transactions costs, and market impact.
Because of the leakage of fees and costs from the system, a staggeringly large percentage of
money invested in marketable securities falls short of producing index-like returns.
Overcoming the costs of active management presents a formidable challenge.
In the context of an extraordinary complex, difficult investing environment, fiduciaries tend
to be surprisingly accepting of active manager pitches. Institutions all too often pursue the
glamorous, exciting (and ultimately costly) hope of market-beating strategies at the expense of
the reliable, mundane certainty of passive management. Instead of examining critically the
factors that drove past performance, investors frequently simply associate superior historical
results with investment acumen.
Because of the nearly insurmountable hurdles in beating the market, prudent investors
approach active strategies with great skepticism. Beginning with the presumption that markets
price assets correctly places the burden of proof on the manager who promises risk-adjusted
excess returns. Only when compelling evidence suggests that a strategy possesses clear potential
to beat the market should investors abandon the passive alternative.
Active managers worth hiring possess personal attributes that create reasonable expectations
of superior performance. In selecting external managers, investors must identify individuals
committed to placing institutional client goals ahead of personal self-interest. Alignment of
interests occurs most frequently in independent investment management firms run in an
entrepreneurial fashion by energetic, intelligent, ethical professionals. Engaging investment
advisors involves consequences beyond issues of financial returns, as fiduciaries entrust both
the institution's assets and reputation to the external management firm.
Even after identifying a promising investment management firm, the job remains
uncompleted until the investor and advisor negotiate satisfactory deal terms. The fundamental
goal in establishing contractual arrangements consists of aligning interests to encourage
investment advisory agents to behave as institutional fiduciary principals. Slippage between
what the investor wishes and what the advisor does imposes substantial costs on institutions,
reducing the likelihood of meeting basic investment goals and objectives.
THE GAME OF ACTIVE MANAGEMENT
The thrill of the chase clouds objectivity in assessing active management opportunities. Playing
the game provides psychic rewards, generating grist for the mill of cocktail party conversation.
Keynes likens active investment to children's entertainment: "For it is, so to speak, a game of
Snap, of Old Maid, of Musical Chairs-a pastime in which he is the victor who says snap
neither too soon nor too late, who passes the Old Maid to his neighbor before the game is over,
who secures a chair for himself when the music stops. These games can be played with zest and
enjoyment, though all the players know that it is the Old Maid which is circulating, or that
when the music stops some of the players will find themselves unscated."! Fiduciaries must
ensure that active management leads to higher expected portfolio returns, not just higher
investment manager job satisfaction.
The willingness to believe t superior performance comes from intelligent hard work
clouds clear judgment. The investment world worships success, deifying the market scer du
Jour. Instead of wondering whether a manager at the top of the performance charts made a
series of lucky picks, observers presume that good results stem from skill. Conversely, in public
perception, poor results follow from lack of ability. Market participants rarely wonder whether
high returns came from accepting greater than market risk, or whether low returns resulted
from lower than market risk. The investment community's lack of skepticism regarding the
source and character of superior returns causes strange characters to be elevated to market guru
status.
Joe Granville
Of all the individuals who moved markets with their predictions, Joe Granville may be among
the strangest. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the technical analyst made a series of "on the
money" predictions. Strikingly, on April 21, 1980 when the market fell to a two-year low of
759, Granville issued a buy signal, anticipating a powerful rally that took the average over 1000
within three months. In January 1981, Granville's next major market call, a sell signal,
prompted "waves of selling," causing markets to decline sharply on record volume. The next
day his picture appeared on the front page of the New York Times, while Washington Post
headlines read "One Forecaster Spurs Hysteria-Markets Sink in Panic Selling."Granville
predicted he would win the Nobel Prize, crowing that he had "solved the 100-year enigma,
calling every market top and bottom."
Granville's technically driven forecasts came replete with costumes and props. His routine
included dressing as Moses to deliver the Ten Commandments of investing, dropping his
trousers to read stock quotations from his boxers, and appearing on stage in a coffin filled with
ticker tape.
Such antics did nothing to diminish his following. In late 1981, markets fell worldwide,
sometimes in apparent response to Granville's calls. According to Rhoda Bramner of Barron's
"while Granville strutted across the investment stage, the market pretty much followed his
bearish script."2
Unfortunately for Granville, he missed the turn of the market in 1982. Stubborn
bearishness kept his followers out of the early stages of one of history's greatest bull markets. In
a crucl twist of fate, Granville turned "wildly bullish" prior to the 1987 crash. As a result, a
1992 study by Hulbert's Financial Digest concluded that Granville ranked last among an
undistinguished group of investment newsletter writers, down 93 percent over the twelve-year
period.
Joe Granville's one-time prominence in the investment world provides evidence of the
investing public's association of superior returns with investment skill. Granville's
methodology relied on technical factors with absolutely no predictive power. Yet he moved
markets, fooling large numbers of people into following his absurd predictions.
The Beardstown Ladies
In the early 1990s, the Beardstown Ladies captured the investing public's attention. Based on
an impressive historical record of beating the S&P 500 by 8.5 percent per year for the ten years
ending in 1993, the matrons of Beardstown parlayed their success into a lucrative writing and
lecturing career. Their first book, The Beardstown Ladies Common-Sense Investment Guide:
How We Beat the Stock Market-And How You Can Too, sold more than 800,000 copies. The
group followed with four more books, The Beardstown Ladies' Pocketbook Guide to Picking
Stocks; The Beardstown Ladies' Guide to Smart Spending for Big Savings: How to Save for a
Rainy Day Without Sacrificing Your Lifestyle; The Beardstown Ladies Stitch-in-Time Guide to
Growing Your Nest Egg: Step-by-Step Planning for a Comfortable Future, and Cookin' Up Profits
on Wall Street. The Beardstown empire, which in addition to books included lectures, videos,
and cassettes, rested on the public's belief in the solid foundation of the Beardstown Ladies'
extraordinary investment success.
All of the hoopla surrounding the Beardstown Ladies met with relatively little skepticism.
Assertions of superior performance provided prima facie evidence of the efficacy of their
investment approach. No further analysis needed.
Unfortunately, the Beardstown Ladies possessed so little analytical ability that calculating
investment returns challenged their capabilities. Because the investment club's treasurer erred
when using a computer program, she reported a two-year return as applying to a ten-year
period. In fact, upon critical examination, the extended record of reported strong relative
performance turned out to be worse than mediocre. Figures compiled by Price Waterhouse
concluded that the Beardstown Ladies produced returns of only 9.1 percent per annum, falling
short of the S&P 500 return by 5.8 percent per year and failing to meet previously reported
results by a staggering 14.3 percent per year. In short, the investment record merits not even a
modest magazine article.
The fundamental lesson from the Beardstown Ladies' saga relates to the attitude investors
take toward performance records, Markets price securities efficiently enough that when
presented with a superior performance record, the initial reaction ought to be that strong
performance most likely resulted from a series of favorable draws from the distribution of
potential outcomes. Only when managers articulate a compelling, coherent investment
philosophy should fiduciaries begin to consider the active management opportunity.
Jim Cramer
Jim Cramer deserves a prominent place in the pantheon of investment anti-heroes. Educated at
Harvard College and Harvard Law School, Cramer squanders his extraordinary credentials and
shamelessly promotes stunningly inappropriate investment advice to an all-too-gullible
audience.
Cramer made a name as an unabashed cheerleader for tech stocks during the Internet
bubble. He rationalized the purchase of absurdly valued securities by asserting that the
professionals "got it wrong" and the public is "much, much smarter than you realize."3 Near
the peak of the market in January 2000, Cramer articulated six "commonsensical rules" that
allow the "average individual" to "routinely beat the professionals." Included in his list of rules
were "buy stocks of companies you like," "buy expensive stocks," and "buy stocks that move in
chunks." Cramer's inane rules proved perfectly timed to inflict the maximum damage to his
readers' portfolios.
Cramer never minces words. He described the "momentum/growth camp" as a group of
investors that would rather buy stocks that have both earnings and technical momentum,
regardless of price. In other words, it doesn't matter how expensive they are, as long as they
execute. "5 Not content simply to promote an irresponsible momentum strategy amid a market
bubble, Cramer took the then long-suffering value managers to task. He registered palpable
contempt for the "value/contrarian camp," contending that "denial is the basis of the value
thesis." He accused value investors of exhibiting "systematic blindness to all things tech,"
chiding Warren Buffett for his "preposterous" preference for "Coke over Microsoft."6
In February 2000, Cramer wrote about the arrogance of value mutual fund managers,
lamenting that "InJot only do they have the guts to tell us that we are wrong to own our Ciscos
and our Yahoo's, they also insist that they are the only authority on what to buy." Cramer
asserted that value managers holding Philip Morris "should have to answer to their dereliction
of duty and added that "the worst are the managers who bought the Cokes and Pepsis..." He
followed with a piece of advice for mutual fund investors in "growth-turned-value stories":
"Take control. Fire these guys.
Of course, Cramer's advice missed the mark by a wide margin. In the year following the
publication of his anti-value rant, Coke gained 10 percent, Pepsi, 36 percent and Philip Morris,
a stunning 171 percent. Meanwhile, Cramer's favorites collapsed, with Cisco down 57 percent
and Yahoo! declining by a staggering 84 percent.
If Cramer's early 2000 preference for Cisco and Yahoo! over Philip Morris and Coke laid
waste to his adherents' portfolios, his calls on the grocery business destroyed even more valuc.
In February 2000, Cramer suggested that "the death knell for value investing may very well be
sounding right now because of technological innovation." He asserted that old economy grocer
Albertsons was "being hit by a fundamental paradigm shift," which will only get worse as
Urban Fetch, Kozmo and Webvan expand." Cramer unequivocally placed his bet on Internet-
cra firms.
Nine months after Cramer's prognostication, Fetch discontinued its consumer delivery
business. Even though Kozmo never executed its hoped-for public offering (sparing Cramer's
readers an opportunity to lose money), the firm managed to muddle through until April 2000
when it ceased operations. Webvan, which boasted a market capitalization of more than $5
billion at the time of Cramer's February 2000 call, filed for bankruptcy in July 2001.
Meanwhile, Albertsons, the dinosaur doomed to extinction, posted profits of more than $500
million on nearly $38 billion of 2001 revenues. Ultimately, on May 30, 2006 Albertsons
succumbed to a takcover by a group led by SuperValu. Scorekeepers note that from the time of
Cramer's misguided, top-of-the-market advice to the date of merger consummation,
Albertsons returned an annualized 0.5 percent per annum, beating the S&P 500's 0.2 percent
per annum and trouncing the NASDAQ's-9.1 percent per annum.
In spite of Jim Cramer's massively misguided top-of-the-market advice, in March 2005,
CNBC gave him his own TV show, Mad Money. On Mad Money, Cramer makes a mockery
of the investment process, throwing chairs, shoving toy bears in meat grinders, wearing
sombreros, and decapitating bobble-head dolls (made in his own likeness). Betwixt and
between his sophomoric antics, Cramer throws out hundreds of stock recommendations. In
fact, according to an August 2007 Barron's article, a database covering six months of Cramer's
picks contained an astounding 3,458 stocks. Barron's concludes that "the credible evidence
suggests that the telestockmeister's picks aren't beating the market. Did you really expect more
from a call-in host who makes 7,000 stock picks a year?" To make a dismal story worse, Cramer
failed to beat the market in spite of a post-broadcast surge of an average of 2 percent for his
picks. Barron's negative assessment would be even more dire were transaction costs and taxes
included.
Aside from Cramer's unsurprising inability to choose thousands of stock market winners in
any given year, he seems to have admitted to market manipulation when he ran a hedge fund in
the late 1990s. In a December 23, 2006 interview with Wall Street Confidential, Cramer flat
out said "... a lot of times when I was short at my hedge fund... I would create a level of
activity beforehand that could drive the futures." He further noted that "it doesn't take much
moncy...." In the interview he goes on to describe ways to manipulate the prices of individual
stocks. 10 According to Barron's, Cramer later "said he'd only been talking hypothetically."11
Surely the Harvard-educated Cramer, who served a stint as editor in chief of the Harvard
Crimson, knows that there is nothing hypothetical in the clause "when I was short at my hedge
fund. Does Jim Cramer need a lesson in the subjunctive?
Joc Granville, the Beardstown Ladies, and Jim Cramer provide compelling evidence that
market participants frequently and uncritically accept simple prominence as proof of sound
underlying investment strategy. The falls from grace suffered by Joe Granville and the
Beardstown Ladies (and perhaps a future fall from grace for Jim Cramer) should encourage
investors to adopt skeptical attitudes when evaluating active management opportunities.
PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS
Real estate investors invoke the mantra "location, location, location." Sensible investors seeking
to engage an active manager focus on "people, people, people." Nothing matters more than
working with high quality partners.
Integrity tops the list of qualifications. Aside from the fact that moral behavior represents a
fundamentally important standard for human interaction, working with ethical advisors
increases the likelihood of investment success. Choosing external advisors of high integrity
reduces the gap between the actions of the advisors and the interests of an institutional fund.
Inevitable differences exist between the interests of an endowment and an outside money
manager. The more profound issues might include differences in financial goals, time horizon,
tax status, and various forms of business risk. Regardless of the structure of contractual
arrangements, external advisors tend to respond to personal incentives. Employing individuals
with high moral standards reduces the severity of conflicts of interest, as ethical managers
consider seriously the goals of the institutional client when resolving conflicts.
Loyalty plays an important part in investment management relationships, allowing longer
term thinking to dominate decision making. In the best of circumstances, the interdependence
of institutional investors and external advisors creates a spirit of partnership, enhancing
opportunities to create successful, lasting relationships.
Loyalty flows both ways. Investors owe external advisors the opportunity to pursue
investment activities within a reasonable time frame. Firing a poorly performing manager
simply to remove an embarrassing line item from a quarterly investment report fails t meet the
test of reasonableness. Likewise, an investment advisor abandoning reliable partners simply to
pursue a lower cost source of capital follows a short-sighted strategy.
Obviously, loyalty does not require permanent maintenance of the status quo.
Relationships between fiduciaries and external managers come to an end for a variety of
compelling reasons. Far too frequently, however, investors abandon good partners for trivial
reasons, imposing unnecessary costs and needlessly disrupting portfolio management activities.
Investment advisors and institutional fund managers operating with a presumption of loyalty
enhance opportunities for long-term success.
Top-notch managers invest with a passion, working to beat the market with a nearly
obsessive focus. Many extraordinary investors spend an enormous amount of time
investigating investment opportunities, working long after rational professionals would have
concluded a job well done. Great investors tend to have a "screw loose," pursuing the game not
for profit, but for sport. Markets fascinate successful investors.
The best investors care about risk. Diligence and hard work take an investment manager
only so far, as even the most carefully researched decisions ultimately face the vicissitudes of
market forces. Because so much lies beyond a portfolio manager's control, superior investors
seek to know as much as can be known, limiting uncertainty to the irreducible minimum. Well-
researched investment ideas tend to be the least risky, since, as Yale's great economist Irving
Fisher observed, "risk varies inversely with knowledge."12
Moncy provides an obvious motivation, bringing enormous wealth to successful investment
advisors. Yet money managers seeking to maximize income constitute a poor group from
which to choose. Profit maximizing business plans involve unbridled asset growth and
unimaginative benchmark hugging strategies, factors at odds with investment success.
Appealing money managers limit assets under management and make aggressive,
unconventional security choices, incurring substantial risks for their money management
business with the hope of generating superior investment returns.
Warren Buffett produced his own set of desirable money manager characteristics in a March
2007 announcement of the search for his successor as Berkshire Hathaway's chief investment
officer:
Picking the right person(s) will not be an easy task. It's not hard, of course, to find smart
people, among them individuals who have impressive investment records. But there is far
more to successful long-term investing than brains and performance that has recently
been good.
Over time, markets will do extraordinary, even bizarre, things. A single, big mistake
could wipe out a long string of successes. We therefore need someone genetically
programmed to recognize and avoid serious risks, including those never before
encountered. Certain perils that lurk in investment strategies cannot be spotted by use of
the models commonly employed today by financial institutions.
Temperament is also important. Independent thinking, emotional stability, and a
keen understanding of both human and institutional behavior is vital to long-term
investment success. I've seen a lot of very smart people who have lacked these virtues.
Finally, we have a special problem to consider: our ability to keep the person we hire.
Being able to list Berkshire on a resume would materially enhance the marketability of an
investment manager. We will need, therefore, to be sure we can retain our choice, even
though he or she could leave and make much more money elsewhere. 13
Even Warren Buffett worries about losing a colleague to a better economic opportunity!
Due diligence on the principals of an investment management organization provides critical
input into the manager selection process. Spending time with manager candidates, both in
business and social settings, allows assessment of whether the manager exhibits characteristics
of a good partner. Questioning individuals on manager-supplied reference lists confirms or
negates impressions gathered in the due diligence process. Contacting people not included on
an official reference list, including past and present colleagues, competitors, and others,
provides opportunities to evaluate the quality of a prospective manager's business dealings and
integrity level.
In the intensely competitive investment management arena, only a small percentage of
managers overcome the enormous burden of fees to post market-beating records. Identifying
members of the small group that will prove to be successful requires an intense focus on
personal characteristics. Only the best of the best will succeed.
ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS
The right people tend to create the right organization, reinforcing the centrality of selecting
strong partners. However, finding great people, while necessary, marks only a starting point in
the search for a money manager, for strong people in a poorly structured organization face the
markets with a significant, unnecessary handicap. In a world rich with alternatives,
compromising on structural issues makes little sense.
Attractive investment management organizations encourage decisions directed toward
creating investment returns, not toward generating fee income. Such principal-oriented
advisors tend to be small, entrepreneurial, and independent.
Size and Client Base
Appropriate size depends on the nature of the investment opportunity. In general, smaller
tends to be better. Market size matters little when trading highly liquid securities such as U.S.
Treasury bonds and large-capitalization domestic equities. Of course, such markets provide few
opportunities to generate excess returns. Interesting active management situations reside in
smaller, less liquid markets, requiring managers to exercise discipline in limiting assets under
management.
Constraints related to the number of clients limit rational firm growth as severely as do
constraints related to asset size. While routine communication might be conducted through
broad-based mailings or by client service personnel, informed clients inevitably require
meaningful amounts of an investment principal's time and energy. An investment advisor
opting for less involved, less burdensome clients makes a potentially serious mistake. First, high
quality clients occasionally provide useful input into the investment process. Second, in the
event that the firm experiences an explicable stretch of poor performance, high quality clients
continue to support the manager's activities. Less sophisticated clients control unreliable
money, oftentimes exhibiting pro-cyclical tendencies, buying high, selling low, and introducing
instability into the investment management operation.
A strong client base creates advantages for both the investment advisor and the clients
themselves. If a money management firm's client roster contains "weak hands," temporary
poor relative performance might cause substantial asset withdrawals. Such withdrawals harm
other clients directly, in the case of transactions costs spread among participants in
commingled funds, and indirectly, in the case of client defections leading to poor firm morale.
In contrast, intelligently supportive clients contribute financial and emotional support to
investment managers experiencing a rough stretch of performance. By adding assets to an
underperforming manager's account, the client stands to profit from a future reversal of
fortune, while the manager benefits from the client's vote of confidence.
Entrepreneurial Attitude
Small, independent firms operate on the opposite end of the spectrum from large subsidiaries
of financial services conglomerates. Appropriate firm size and sensible ownership structures
contribute to superior investment results. The tendency of smaller, principal-oriented firms to
behave in an entrepreneurial fashion provides critical context to the investment management
process. Entrepreneurial environments emphasize people, putting them ahead of bureaucracy
and structure. By placing people first, investment organizations increase chances for success.
In entrepreneurial organizations, individuals drive decisions, placing great importance on
selecting partners with attractive behavioral characteristics. Great people provide the core of a
strong entrepreneurial operation, according to venture capitalist Len Baker, because they
"execute better, respond better to surprise, and attract other great people." He suggests that
managers "be out there, be obsessive, and be bottom up."14
Entrepreneurial capitalism rests on three driving forces: innovation, ownership, and
adaptation. Each characteristic contributes to successful money management organizations.
Innovation
According to Schumpeter, innovators "see things which only subsequently prove to be true."15
By building an investment process that promotes foresight, investment advisors lay the
groundwork for success. Excess returns stem from out-of-the-mainstream positions that
subsequently achieve recognition, often in startling surprise to ordinary market observers. By
identifying the unexpected consequence before the fact, successful investment managers realize
superior returns from exploiting superior insights. Without creative portfolio choices,
investment managers face dismal prospects, since the old combination represents the consensus
view. Market efficiency drives returns on market-like portfolios to the average, causing
conventional portfolios with conventional ideas to produce conventional results, a poor
outcome for active investment managers.
In efforts to innovate, entrepreneurs encourage experimentation, accepting occasional
shortfalls as the price paid for potential gains. Repeated failure precedes success in many
entrepreneurial endeavors, requiring an organizational culture that encourages
experimentation and accepts mistakes. By explicitly permitting failure, but holding down its
costs, investment organizations create an environment allowing managers to construct truly
novel, high-potential investment portfolios.
Ownership
Financial and psychic ownership leads to superior results. Strong investment management
firms reward contributions monetarily while engaging the hearts and minds of staff members.
Widely distributed ownership enhances organizational stability, facilitating long-term thinking.
Carefully structured financial incentives elicit appropriate behavior from investment
personnel, discouraging fee-driven activity and encouraging return-generating behavior.
Psychic ownership provides a powerful complement to financial rewards. By causing investors
to "buy in" to the process, interests of manager and client come together.
Adaptation
Adaptation involves careful selection, amplifying the strong and eliminating the weak. In
choosing a portfolio of attractive positions from a large universe of potential opportunities,
successful investors express unusual insights ahead of the herd. Strong ideas command
meaningful portions of assets, magnifying the impact of high conviction positions, while weak
positions disappear. When circumstances change, managers reconfigure portfolios to reflect
new realities. Not only does adaptation influence the tactics of security selection, but as
markets evolve, adaptation may lead to new investment strategies. If inefficiencies disappear in
a particular niche, the entrepreneur leaves the unattractive market and secks new mispricings to
exploit. Both tactically and strategically, adaptation plays an important role in money
management.
Contrast the flexibility of entrepreneurial organizations with bureaucracies. Bureaucratic
structures deal effectively with repetitive, regular, slow-to-change environments. Control-
oriented processes emphasize structure, subordinating the role of people. Bureaucracies employ
conventional wisdom and seek consensus, punishing failure quickly and ruthlessly. By
pursuing safety and avoiding controversy, bureaucratic structures systematically screen out the
market opportunities likely to yield superior returns. Bureaucracies deal poorly with constantly
changing market environments and fail to address even clementary active investment
management problems.
Many bureaucratic functionaries pursue investment with "name brand" money managers,
reducing career risk by choosing widely recognized firms blessed by an external consultant.
Large, process-driven entities that produce consistent results provide a safe haven for the timid
client. Well-respected firms develop franchises, using their good name to attract and retain
assets. In the realm of marketable investments, the franchise provides no benefit to the
portfolio management process. The value of the franchise lies solely in the comfort level
provided to clients.
Comfortable investment decisions fail to generate exciting results. Discomfort represents a
necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition of success. Because entrepreneurial firms tend to be
newer and smaller, track records may be harder to define and interpret. Less process-driven
strategies depend heavily on individuals, reducing the fiduciary's ability to rely on the franchise
for results. While backing an entrepreneurial group takes more courage than serving up a
"name brand" recommendation, investment success may require backing managers without
standard institutional credentials.
Unfortunately, once-attractive investment partners sometimes mature into unattractive
bureaucracies. Schumpeter's concept of creative destruction takes hold, as organizations evolve
from small entrepreneurial "craft shops" to large enterprises with characteristics that
undermine the premise that supported forming the firm in the first place. As the organization
grows, mutation "... incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within,
incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one."16 Institutional acceptability
threatens the very characteristics that made the firm interesting in the first place. As time and
size crode the entrepreneurial enthusiasm that brought initial success to the firm, the fund
manager needs to reject the old partners and seek new partners to provide superior
management capabilities. The process of creative truction, which Schumpeter concludes is
"the essential fact about capitalism," poses challenges for investment management
organizations. 17
Investment Guerrillas
Miles Morland, formerly general partner of Blakeney Management, captured the essence of the
strengths of an entrepreneurial investment management organization in a letter describing why
he did not proceed with a contemplated Joint venture involving a much larger financial services
conglomerate. Blakeney manages assets in Africa and the Middle East.
I am afraid we are not going to go ahead with our merger.... Blakeney is a small group
of guerrillas. Our success comes from our ability to fight and forage in places too small
and too risky for people with more to lose. That is also what makes it such an
exhilarating place to work. We are focused completely on getting and doing business
with no thought for our supply lines or on whose territory we are trespassing. [Your
firm] is a big and powerful uniformed army. Thanks to you it has retained its
entrepreneurial spirit more than any other large American firm but that is like saying
that the parachute troops are more entrepreneurial than the tank battalions. Big firms by
their nature need disciplines and chains of command. Their sheer size means that when
they venture overseas they build complex relationships with other powers in other lands
who speak the same language.....
Guerrillas cannot be integrated into the regular army without losing what it is that
makes them effective. All the professionals at Blakeney have previously been officers in
the regular army and have deserted to join the guerrillas. It is the thought that you
personally are a guerrilla at heart that has made us go on with the negotiations despite
the warning signs. If we ask ourselves how will this deal help us do more and better
business, and how will it make our lives more interesting and more fun, we cannot find
an answer. Everything points in the opposite direction. This is no criticism of [your
firm] or the excellent people we have gotten to know there. It is the reality of forming an
affiliation with someone as big as you. Even if we don't have to put on uniforms we will
have to run our business in a way that acknowledges the rules that are imposed on you
and when we go foraging for business we will have to respect your existing alliances. We
are rustlers by nature not herders. We want to make lightning raids in Zimbabwe and
Ghana and Egypt while your partners... are holding meetings to decide... about how
and where they are going to deploy their mighty troops. When they arrive we hope they
will find a few of the local cattle are missing.
... I hope we can continue to do things together. All this only started because of the
respect I have for you personally. I bear the blame for not realizing sooner what the
implications of the deal were. At the end of the day, we might have been the majority
shareholder and you the minority one, but if a majority mouse lics down with a minority
clephant it is not the elephant who is going to end up as a pancake.
By selecting investment managers with an entrepreneurial orientation, fiduciaries improve
the chances for investment success. Large, multiproduct, process-driven firms face the daunting
hurdle of overcoming bureaucratic obstacles. Small, focused, independent firms with excellent
people provide the highest likelihood of identifying the contrarian path to excellent investment
results.
Independent Organizations
Investors increase the degree of coincidence of interests with fund managers by choosing to
work with focused, independent firms. Particularly severe conflicts between investor goals and
money manager actions arise in "financial supermarkets"-large, bureaucratic organizations
that offer a variety of investment management options. Employees at financial conglomerates
turn over at substantially greater rates than at independent firms. Compensation explains part
of the reason. The investment management subsidiary's revenues flow to the financial
supermarket, which takes some as profit and returns some as salary to the subsidiary's
principals. Successful portfolio managers employed by supermarkets have the option of simply
moving across the street, opening up shop, and garnering 100 percent of the revenues
associated with their efforts. The profit objective of the financial supermarket creates instability
at the investment management subsidiary, opening a gap between the interests of the firm and
the client. A desire for independence explains another part of the reason for high employee
turnover. The opportunity to operate without interference from bureaucrats intent on serving
corporate interests appeals to the best investment minds. Ill-informed, outside intervention in
the decision-making process, however well-intentioned, creates the potential for suboptimal
outcomes and provides incentive to establish an independent firm. A final motivation comes
from a sense of ownership. Owner operators simply work harder and better than rank-and-file
employees. Small, independent, entrepreneurial organizations provide greater coincidence of
interest between firm and client.
Investment focus improves the chances of satisfying client objectives. A narrow product line
forces managers to live and die by investment results, creating an enormous incentive to
produce superior returns. In contrast, a firm with a broad product line anticipates that hoped-
for gains on winning products more than offset inevitable losses on losing strategies, reducing
the cost of any single product failure. Even worse, in secking steady streams of income, financial
supermarket managers fashion broadly diversified portfolios, tracking market benchmarks
closely enough to avoid termination and too closely to achieve excellence. Investors prefer that
fund managers place all their eggs in one basket, and watch that basket with great care. By
selecting concentrated, focused managers, investors increase chances for success.
In pursuing stable flows of revenues, financial conglomerates seek income growth at the
expense of investment performance. Investment managers soon recognize that rewards come
primarily from attracting new cash flows, not generating superior investment returns. Since
size is the enemy of performance, asset gatherers win at their clients' expense.
Public ownership of an investment management organization introduces another set of
issues for the firm's clients. While the goals of a privately held financial supermarket differ
materially from the interests of the money management clients, in the case of a publicly owned
money manager the introduction of outside shareholders further exacerbates the conflicts of
interest. The most obvious, and perhaps the most severe, problem concerns the conflict of
interest between money management clients and external shareholders.
Fortress Investment Group
When an independent investment management firm files to go public, the offering documents
contain clues regarding the consequences for owners of the firm, their clients, and the public
shareholders-to-be. But, offering documents frequently fail to address head-on the
fundamental conflict that arises from introducing public shareholders into the mix. In the
context of a private firm, the investment manager accepts the responsibility to provide superior
investment results to clients that entrust assets to the investment manager's care. In the context
of a public firm, the investment manager retains the responsibility to serve the clients' interests
and adds a responsibility to public shareholders. The interests of the clients and the public
shareholders often conflict.
The public offering of shares in the Fortress Investment Group, a $26 billion manager of
private equity partnerships, hedge funds, and publicly traded alternative investment vehicles,
highlights the issues confronting a publicly traded firm's clients. Take the case of dividends.
The November 2006 registration statement proudly notes that "unlike many publicly traded
asset managers, we intend to pay out a significant portion... of our annual distributable
earnings in the form of quarterly dividends. "18 Substantial dividends clearly benefit
shareholders. In contrast, investors in Fortress's asset management products suffer from the
firm's dividend policy.
Consider the source funds for dividend payments. The most reliable income stream
comes from the management fees that Fortress charges for asset management services. Higher
fees and increased assets under management benefit the public shareholder. Neither higher fees
nor increased assets benefit the clients of the Fortress funds. In fact, both factors produce lower
investment returns. To add insult to injury, some portion of the fees paid by Fortress's clients
go not to the principals making the investment decisions, but to faccless public shareholders.
The issue of dividend payments highlights the conflict between clients and shareholders.
In an attempt to justify the public offering, the offering statement includes a helpful section
entitled "Why We Are Going Public," that contains the headers People, Permanence, Capital,
and Currency. With respect to "People," Fortress suggests that publicly traded shares would
"increase our ability to provide financial incentives to our existing and future employees."19
The Fortress statement ignores the obvious fact that public shareholders claim a portion of the
funds that otherwise would have been available for distribution to the firm's investment
professionals. A public offering diminishes the size of the compensation pool, making
Fortress's claim disingenuous at best.
Regarding "Permanence," Fortress expects to benefit from an increase in the proportion of
capital that institutions and individuals allocate to the firm. No evidence exists that capital
providers prefer publicly traded firms to privately held firms. In fact, if capital providers seek
high risk-adjusted returns, the fundamentals support the opposite conclusion.
As to "Capital" and "Currency", Fortress suggests that publicly traded shares facilitate the
firm's ability to grow, create new investment products, and finance future strategic
acquisitions. Increases in assets and numbers of products may well benefit Fortress principals
and public shareholders, but do nothing to serve the interests of the clients of Fortress funds.
Strangely absent from the list of reasons to go public is "Greed." Just prior to the IPO, on
December 18, 2006 the Fortress principals (five in number) sold 15 percent of the firm to
Japanese securities firm Nomura "for approximately $888 million, all of the proceeds of which
went to the Principals. "20 Moreover, between September 30, 2006 and the consummation of
the IPO, the Fortress S-1 registration statement noted that "we distributed $528.5 million to
our principals. "21 In addition, careful readers who make it to page 80 of the offering circular
note that shortly prior to the initial public offering, the principals of Fortress entered into a
$750 million credit agreement, which provided funds for refinancing a prior $175 million
credit facility and for "investment in various existing and new Fortress Funds, and to make a
one-time $250 million distribution of capital to our principals,"22 Finally, in a tangle of
complexity that only a lawyer could love, the registration statement describes a "tax receivable
agreement," which might produce payments to the principals that "could be material in
amount. "23
Between the $888 million Nomura windfall, the $528.5 million of pre-IPO distributions,
and the $250 million loan distribution, the five principals of Fortress cashed in to the tune of
$1,666.5 million. Finding the three elements of the Fortress principals' paydays required careful
reading of pages and pages of legalistic prose in the company's disclosure documents. In a
straightforward world, the section entitled "Why We Are Going Public" would contain one
header, "Greed," that transparently outlined the $1.7 billion of payments to the fortunate few.
The Fortress IPO clearly benefits the senior principals of the firm and just as clearly imposes
costs on both the Junior Fortress professionals and the firm's clients. By giving a piece of the pic
to outside shareholders and by cashing out themselves, the senior principals leave far less to
compensate their subordinates. By introducing a responsibility to serve the interests of public
shareholders, Fortress creates a conflict with their fiduciary obligation to clients. Public
offerings of money management firms benefit the few at the expense of many.
United Asset Management
United Asset Management (UAM), a once-acquisitive conglomerate of investment advisors,
illustrates the problems with external ownership of investment managers. At the end of 1998,
with equity interests in forty-five firms and managing in excess of $200 billion, UAM ranked
among the world's largest owners of investment management firms. While the firm boasted an
impressive level of assets under management, UAM operated with a fundamentally flawed
strategy.
The UAM investment manager roster included a number of well-known, highly regarded
groups, including Acadian Asset Management and Murray Johnstone Limited. While superior
historical performance created UAM manager reputations, their acquisition by UAM dimmed
prospects for future excess returns. The emphasis on asset gathering, loss of entrepreneurial
drive, and diversion of revenues to passive shareholders created conditions that led to
investment mediocrity.
Even though UAM's 1997 annual report lists the name, address, and investment strategy of
each of the firm's affiliated managers, no performance data appear. Net client withdrawals of
$16.0 billion in 1997, representing 9.4 percent of assets at the beginning of the year, pointed to
the conclusion that managers produced generally unsatisfactory performance. The few textual
references to investment performance do little to confuse the annual report's clear message:
manager rewards stem from increasing assets under management, not from generating superior
investment returns.
Board chairman Norton Reamer addresses the leakage of assets by identifying "improving
our firms' net client cash flow [as] our top priority in 1998....24 The report later outlines
incentive programs to reach the goal, "which is clearly a function of improved client service
and retention as well as product development and marketing." Where is the reference to
investment returns? The annual report indicates that new acquisitions will "concentrate on
firms with the highest growth potential," not on firms most likely to provide superior
performance.
In spite of a roaring bull market, UAM failed to increase "net client cash flow." Throughout
1998, nearly $20 billion
assets left the money management firms under UAM's umbrella.
While UAM continued to articulate a goal of increasing assets through improved client
servicing, the firm announced several investment-oriented initiatives designed to improve
performance.
The performance improvement initiatives evidently failed, as 1999 proved no more
successful than 1998. UAM's annual report noted that assets under management increased a
scant $1.2 billion during the bull-market year, investment gains of $22.5 billion only slightly
surpassed client outflows of $21.1 billion.
On June 16, 2000, UAM threw in the towel, entering into an agreement to sell the firm to
Old Mutual. The Wall Street Journal noted that the purchase price, which amounted to about
1.2 percent of assets under management, stood at the low end of the "going rate of 1%-to-5% of
assets," reflecting some of the restructuring work that lies ahead. "25 Trevor Moss, a London-
based securities analyst, observed that UAM had "about the same level of assets under
management that it had about five years ago," a dismal showing in the context of the U.S.
equity market's nearly threefold increasc.26
UAM fizzled for a variety of reasons. External ownership of investment firms inevitably
alters the institutional culture, diminishing the entrepreneurial spirit so critical to successful
money management organizations. When senior professionals "cash out," the single-minded
focus on generating strong results dissipates, sapping the vitality of the firm. After the sale of a
firm, junior professionals face a less rosy future. According to UAM disclosure documents,
after a typical acquisition, only 50 percent to 70 percent of revenues remain with the
investment management firm. The diversion of resources to passive external shareholders
reduces the size of the pic available for distribution to investment professionals, creating
instability. Employees of professional services firms with substantial outside ownership enjoy
the option of moving across the street, setting up shop and garnering a greater share of the
newly formed independent firm's profits.
In October 2007, Old Mutual's president and chief executive officer Scott Powers
acknowledged the challenge of external ownership, noting that "[i]t's taken us a while to figure
out the right mix of short-term and long-term incentives." Five years after the UAM purchase,
Old Mutual "largely completed the process of changing revenue sharing agreements into
profit sharing arrangements, a step that reduces incentives to gather assets. In 2007, Powers
articulated a longer term goal "to get cquity into the hands of our affiliates." While providing
equity ownership to the principals of investment management subsidiaries moves the
organizational structure in the right direction, the ultimate sharing of equity necessarily falls
short of the 100 percent ownership characteristic of an independent investment manager.27
Pursuit of investment excellence in the context of a conglomerate of investment managers
proves futile, as the goals of external owners fail to coincide with the aspirations of investors.
Asset gathering creates discconomies of scale for investors, decreasing the possibility of
achieving superior performance. The transformation of senior managers from owners to
employees creates changes in firm culture that disadvantage investors. Finally, compensation
for external shareholders impairs the money management firm's ability to pay portfolio
managers at competitive levels, leading to turnover among personnel and posing risks to
investor assets. Significant external ownership of asset management firms creates barriers to
investment success.
Investment Banks and Investment Management
Conflicts of interest abound in the financial world, with large, complex organizations facing
the widest range of issues. Investment banks frequently sponsor private equity funds, using
access to proprietary deal flow as a selling point. Unfortunately, deals originated by the
investment banking network come with built-in conflicts. When a company engages an
investment bank to sell a division, alarm bells should ring when the banker suggests that the
investment bank's private equity fund purchase the division. Is the investment bank serving the
interest of a good corporate client by paying a rich price for the division? Or, is the investment
bank serving the interest of the private equity fund by paying a low price? Under such
circumstances, fairness opinions notwithstanding, no fair price exists.
Less subtle conflicts permeate the process. Investment banks sometimes put themselves in
untenable positions, advising companies at the same time as they provide financing. In August
2007, Lehman Brothers found itself horribly conflicted when its Home Depot Supply
transaction floundered amid the LBO debt crunch. As reported in the International Herald
Tribune, Lehman "advised Home Depot on the sale at the same time it was also providing
financing to the buying group. Suddenly, Lehman was turning around and threatening to
scuttle a deal it had advised one of its most important clients to accept. "28
Ultimately, Goldman Sachs replaced Lehman as an advisor and Lehman retraded the deal,
obtaining more lucrative terms for its financing. Advisory and financing roles always conflict;
the stresses of the LBO funding crisis brought the conflict into high relief.
After deals close, investment banks often continue to provide financial advisory and capital
markets services to portfolio companies. In an unusual public description of the bonanza
created by captive private equity funds, the December 14, 1990 Wall Street Journal detailed
fees generated by Morgan Stanley's investment in Burlington Industries.
Morgan Stanley and Burlington Industries
In 1987, Morgan Stanley's leveraged buyout fund invested $46 million of equity in the $2.2
billion purchase of Burlington Industries. Over the next three years, the investment bank
charged the company more than $120 million in fees for services ranging from underwriting to
advising on divestitures. Because Morgan Stanley controlled the board of Burlington
Industries, decisions regarding financing and divestitures were neither arm's length nor
exposed to market forces. At best, all transactions benefited the company, with Morgan Stanley
compensated at market rates for services rendered. At worst, unnecessary transactions
generated above-market fees, disadvantaging the company and Morgan Stanley fund investors.
When a fund sponsor profits by charging advisory fees at the direct expense of investors,
serious conflicts of interest ensue.
Noting that "nearly every time Burlington needed advice, Morgan Stanley turned on the
meter," Wall Street Journal reporter George Anders suggests that "the story of Burlington
Industries raises troubling questions about Wall Street's foray into merchant banking. "29 Fees
generated by Morgan Stanley "for everything from underwriting Burlington's high yield debt
to overseeing a blizzard of divestitures" dwarf the
aity investment made by the partners of
Morgan Stanley in the Burlington transaction, providing handsome returns to the investment
bank irrespective of the returns delivered to the firm's private equity investors.30
Goldman Sachs and the Water Street Corporate Recovery Fund
Goldman Sachs created an even more extensive web of conflicts when in 1990 it established the
Water Street Corporate Recovery Fund, a $783 million "vulture fund" set up to make
concentrated investments in distressed securities. Hoping to be viewed as a savior of bankrupt
companies, instead Goldman stirred up a hornet's nest of conflicts.
One set of conflicts existed between Goldman's financial restructuring advisory business
and control investing in distressed situations. Investment banks generally rely on "Chinese
walls" to contain sensitive data supplied by clients in the course of advisory assignments,
keeping inside information away from securities analysts and traders. The term Chinese wall
may be employed because such walls are easily removed at an assignment's end. A cynic (or
realist) might argue that paper-thin permeability more aptly describes Chinese walls. Because
Goldman partner Mikael Salovaara both ran the Water Street Fund and continued to advise
clients on restructuring, any shred of separation between the business disappeared, causing
"traders at other firms (to joke) that Mr. Salovaara had a 'Chinese wall' in the middle of his
brain."31
The Water Street Fund investment in distressed bonds of toy-maker Tonka illustrates several
strands of the web of conflicts. After accumulating a position in Tonka's debt securities,
Salovaara competed for an assignment to advise Mattel on a possible acquisition of Tonka, in
the process, perhaps, picking up potentially valuable non-public information regarding the
value and salability of Tonka's bonds. Goldman's advantage infuriated Junk bond investors not
privy to the information, causing several to complain publicly and to suggest they would
reduce activity with Goldman's trading desk. 32
Ultimately, Tonka agreed to be acquired by Hasbro, creating yet another problem for
Goldman. The Water Street Fund owned more than half of Tonka's bonds, having acquired
the position at less than 50 percent of face value.33 Even though Tonka's board of directors
wished to sell the company to Hasbro, Goldman played hardball, holding out for more money
for the firm's bond position. While such tactics raise few eyebrows in the rough and tumble
world of distressed debt, some clients saw Goldman's actions as inconsistent with the firm's
avowal to avoid any participation in hostile merger activity. Ultimately, the investment bank's
tactics worked, increasing payments received for the Tonka bond position by reducing the
value of other participants Tonka and Hasbro shareholdings. Goldman's investment returns
came at great expense, tarnishing the firm's reputation for putting clients first.
A final strand in the conflict web relates to Goldman's junk bond trading activity. To avoid
competition, the firm limited the high yield trading desk's activity in bonds that interested the
Water Street Fund. Goldman's trading clients, already concerned about the firm's possible
informational advantages, faced market makers less able to take positions.
Goldman's advisory conflict troubles went beyond the Tonka casc. According to an article
in the June 4, 1991 Wall Street Journal, "nine of twenty-one companies that the Water Street
Fund selected for restructuring' are or were Goldman clients."34 Perceptions mounted that
Goldman invested the Water Street Fund with an unfair advantage.
Faced with a storm of controversy, Goldman shut down the fund in May 1991, several years
ahead of schedule. Even though the Water Street Fund generated handsome returns during its
abbreviated life, the fund's enduring legacy may be its rich series of lessons on conflicts of
interest.
Goldman Sachs and the Global Equity Opportunities Fund
In mid August 2007, Goldman Sachs faced unprecedented carnage in its hedge fund portfolio.
The firm's flagship $7.5 billion Global Alpha Fund, managed by Mark Carhart and Raymond
Iwanowski, posted a stunning year-to-date decline of 27 percent. 35 The lower profile North
American Equity Opportunities Fund dropped 25 percent in the first seven and a half months
of the year. And, for good measure, the Global Equity Opportunities Fund lost a stunning 30
percent of its value in the second week of August alone.36 In aggregate, the net value of the
three funds managed by Carhart and Iwanowski declined by an impressive $4.7 billion during
the first cight months of the calendar year.
Goldman had no skin in the game. The firm's chief financial officer David Viniar
characterized Goldman's investments as "nothing substantial; very immaterial, if at all."
Goldman simply collected fees for mismanaging the hedge funds; the losses belonged to the
firm's investors. Yet, presented with an extreme market dislocation, Goldman chose to become
a principal.
In response to the dramatic price declines, Goldman Sachs arranged a $3 billion injection
into the Global Equity Opportunities Fund, of which approximately $2 billion came from
Goldman Sachs itself. On a conference call explaining the move, David Viniar asserted the
infusion of capital benefited Goldman Sachs and "the current investors in the fund, giving
them the firepower to take advantage of the opportunities in the market today." In reality,
Goldman used the bulk of the infusion to play defense. The fund managers employed the cash
contribution to bring the fund's leverage down from an irresponsible level of approximately 6
to 1 to a still high (but more defensible) level of around 3.5 to 1.37
Goldman's move raises a number of questions. If, indeed, the move benefited existing
clients by reducing leverage and providing firepower, why did Goldman choose to benefit only
clients of the Global Equity Opportunities Fund? What of the fiduciary responsibility of
Goldman Sachs to clients invested in the Global Alpha Fund and the North American Equity
Opportunities Fund? Goldman Sachs's David Viniar noted that the fund managers were
reducing risk and reducing leverage in both Global Alpha and North American Equity
Opportunities. Why should Global Equity Opportunities receive a so-called benefit from
Goldman in the form of a cash contribution that presumably allowed low-cost deleveraging,
while the unfavored funds faced the market-related costs of selling assets in a hostile trading
environment?
The timing of Goldman's investment raises questions about the firm's favored access to
what senior management characterized as "a good investment opportunity." Instead of
providing the opportunity to existing clients of the Global Equity Opportunities Fund,
Goldman took the lion's share for itself and reached out to a select group of investors for the
rest, ultimately raising $1 billion from the likes of Eli Broad, C.V. Starr (Maurice "Hank"
Greenberg), and Perry Capital, 38 As a fiduciary for the investors in Global Equity
Opportunities Fund, should not Goldman first offer the chance to take advantage of the fund's
opportunities to the existing investors?
Viewed from another perspective, Goldman's investment in Global Equity Opportunities
might actually harm the fund's clients, in contrast to the benefit that Goldman claims.
Goldman and the firm's favored co-investors enjoyed the opportunity to invest $3 billion in the
Global Equity Opportunities Fund at net asset value on the day of their choosing. Goldman
got a sweet deal. Had the $3 billion been invested in the securities that comprise the fund, the
market impact of the sizable trades would no doubt force prices up, increasing Goldman's cost
basis. Instead, by using the contributed assets to reduce leverage, Goldman bought in at a price
that otherwise would have been impossible to achieve. Existing investors suffered dilution of
their position.
Finally, Goldman Sachs provided the cherry-picking investors better deal terms than those
accorded the existing Global Equity Opportunities Fund investors. In an analyst conference
call, Goldman Sachs president and co-chief operating officer Gary Cohen noted that the firm's
cash infusion put Goldman in an "equal position to all the existing investors." In fact, the new
money pays no management fee, pays a reduced carry of 10 percent, and benefits from a hurdle
rate of 10 percent. Because Goldman and the other favored investors received preferential terms
on their investment, their actions certainly disadvantaged the existing fund investors.
In any event, Goldman picked an opportune time to make its commitment to the Global
Equity Opportunities Fund. Bloomberg reported that in the week following the cash infusion,
the fund rose 12 percent. A September 20th AP release noted that Goldman's investment had
appreciated 16 percent in little more than a month. At least in the short run, Goldman made
out well. Global Equity Opportunities Fund clients shared in the rebound, but by dint of
Goldman's investment, in an attenuated fashion. Presented with an attractive investment
opportunity, Goldman became a principal, riding roughshod over the interests of the firm's
hedge fund clients and enriching itself in the process.
While investors cannot avoid conflicts entirely, fewer differences in interest exist when investing
with independent investment management organizations. Avoiding affiliates and subsidiaries
of financial services firms does little to reduce the rich set of investment manager alternatives.
DEAL STRUCTURE
Appropriate deal terms play an important role in producing satisfactory investment results.
After identifying an attractive investment management firm, investors face the issue of
evaluating (or negotiating) compensation arrangements. The degree of efficiency in asset
pricing determines in part the nature of the compensation scheme, with passive management
of efficiently priced securities demanding different treatment from active exploitation of
anomalously priced assets. All aspects of investment management fee structures contain
potential for conflict between the interests of investors and investment managers, forcing
fiduciaries to pay close attention to explicit and implicit incentives embodied in management
contracts.
Co-investment
Co-investment provides a powerful means of aligning fiduciary and fund manager interests. To
the extent that a manager becomes a principal, issues regarding agency behavior diminish.
Unfortunately, along with substantial co-investment, issues arise regarding possible differences
in goals between mortal, taxpaying money managers and immortal, tax-exempt institutional
investors. That said, co-investment reduces the incentive for investment advisors to profit at the
expense of clients.
While any level of co-investment encourages fund managers to act like principals, the larger
the personal commitment of funds the greater the focus on generating superior investment
returns. Managers cease to benefit from attracting new capital at the point where the return
diminution on the manager's personal stake caused by increasing assets under management
exceeds the opportunity costs of fees foregone by limiting asset growth. Because the easily
measured level of fees foregone generally eclipses the fuzzy estimate of size-induced
performance drag, only the wealthiest managers confront a clear trade-off favoring asset growth
limitations. Even though the numbers might favor asset-gathering strategies for most managers,
substantial levels of co-investment send strong signals to investors regarding the principal
orientation of fund managers. The idea that a fund manager believes strongly enough in the
investment product to put a substantial personal stake in the fund suggests that the manager
shares the investor's orientation.
Investment of personal assets side-by-side with client capital creates a powerful alignment of
interests. While profit participations focus manager attention on the investor goal of generating
handsome investment returns, a profit sharing arrangement in which managers share only in
gains creates an option that encourages risk-secking behavior. By making a substantial co-
investment, managers participate directly in gains and losses, leading to more balanced
assessment of investment opportunities. To realize the hoped-for behavioral outcome, the co-
investment commitment must be large relative to the manager's net worth, even though the
amount might be modest in absolute terms. When writing a check representing a material
portion of personal assets, the investment manager steps into the role of a principal.
While co-investment generally improves the investor's position by aligning investment
interests, differences in goals bear careful scrutiny. Taxpaying fund managers in partnership
with tax-exempt institutional investors face different after-tax return scenarios. Mortal decision
makers operate with shorter time horizons than appropriate for an enduring organization's
permanent funds. Individuals with large fund investments frequently desire greater
diversification than required by most institutions, which hold an already well-diversified
collection of assets. Even though differences in tax status, time horizon, and risk tolerance drive
wedges between the interests of individual fund managers and the goals of institutional
investors, the benefits of substantial co-investment far outweigh the likely costs.
Compensation Arrangements for Marketable Securities
The character of sensible compensation arrangements for investment managers varies with the
degree of efficiency in asset pricing. Passive management of government bonds demands fee
arrangements different from those appropriate for active management of private equity. For
most asset classes investors face well-entrenched fee arrangements, ranging from asset-based fees
for relatively efficiently priced marketable securities to a combination of asset-based fees and
incentive payments for less efficiently priced asset types. Because marketplace practices
frequently deviate from ideal compensation structures, price-taking investors generally take the
pragmatic approach of choosing the best option from a set of bad alternatives.
Passive Strategies
Passive asset management differs fundamentally from active asset management. Size, the enemy
of active investors, works in favor of index fund managers. For example, passive funds with
large numbers of investors and sizable pools of assets frequently offer crossing opportunities, in
which some portion of exiting investor demand for funds matches entering investor supply of
funds, allowing nearly costless exit from and entrance to the investment pool. Scale improves
tracking of benchmarks, as large size facilitates full replication of the investment universe,
reducing the need for tracking-error-inducing sampling procedures. Experience shows that
funds with billions of dollars track benchmarks with little or no slippage.
Barclays Global Investors, one of the world's largest index fund managers, offers a wide
variety of products designed to mirror various marketable security benchmarks, segregated into
distinct pools for different types of investors. The largest pool of assets, designed to track the
S&P 500, contained $127 billion on December 31, 2006. Before fees the fund returned 8.46
percent for the trailing ten years relative to 8.42 percent for the S&P 500 index. The much
smaller bond pool, with $1.6 billion on December 31, 2006, showed similarly impressive
results, with ten-year returns of 6.33 percent relative to 6.26 percent for the Lehman Brothers
Government Corporate Index. The commodity-like nature of passive investing commands
commodity-like compensation. Index fund managers compete with the alternative of
internally managed passive portfolios, forcing fees to a paltry two basis points per year for large
accounts,III By choosing passive alternatives for efficiently priced assets, investors expect
predictable results at a bargain price.
While strong arguments support passive management for all marketable securities, two
factors argue strongly for passive management of bond portfolios in particular. First, to satisfy
the deflation hedging role of fixed income, investors must hold long-term, high quality, non-
callable bonds, suggesting the creation of stable duration government bond portfolios. Second,
the extraordinary efficiency in the pricing of government bonds makes active security selection
decisions a costly exercise in futility. The need for a stable maturity structure and the futility of
individual security bets require that investors manage bond portfolios passively.
While domestic equity investors enjoy more flexibility in structuring portfolios than bond
investors, the difficulty of identifying material mispricings in the stock market, particularly
among large-capitalization securities, leads many investors to index common stocks. By
avoiding high fees and substantial transactions costs, index funds provide long-term results that
represent a formidable hurdle for investors hoping to outperform. Yet, in spite of the clear
difficulties in producing risk-adjusted excess returns, most investors pursue active management
strategies.
Active Strategies
Careful active investors pay close attention to fee arrangements, recognizing that fees represent
a substantial obstacle to market-beating performance. Active managers of marketable securities
generally receive asset-based fees in exchange for portfolio management services. On one level,
interests coincide. To the extent that a manager increases assets through superior investment
performance, both the manager and the investor win as the manager's income increases and the
investor's return pleases. On other levels, interests conflict. The manager may pursuc a "staying
in business strategy to protect fee income by closet indexing, holding a market-like portfolio
unlikely to produce results that would lead to termination. Perhaps even more damaging, the
manager may conclude that gathering assets provides greater fee income than generating
superior returns.
In growing assets, managers simply respond to economic incentives. With asset-based fees,
income increases as assets under management increase. Frequently, managers find it easier to
add assets by attracting new accounts than by creating excess returns. With distressingly few
exceptions, fund managers aggressively pursue marketing activities, attempting to gather as
many assets as possible. Retaining assets requires avoiding disastrous performance, causing
money managers to create market-like portfolios that all but eliminate the chance for superior
performance. Investment management represents, at best, a secondary consideration for most
institutional fund managers.
Creating appropriate deal structures allows investors to mitigate many of the conflicts
inherent in the investment advisory relationship. Sensible fee arrangements contain two
elements: base compensation that covers reimbursement of reasonable overhead costs and
incentive compensation that rewards a manager's value added. The incentive compensation, or
profits interest, represents a share of the returns generated in excess of a benchmark
appropriate to the investment activity. For example, large-capitalization domestic marketable
equity managers might be rewarded for returns generated in excess of the S&P 500, while
foreign equity managers might receive a profits interest in returns above the Morgan Stanley
Capital International EAFE Index. Fair deal structures, rare in the investment management
arena, encourage appropriate behavior on the part of money managers.
Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of marketable security managers employ asset-
based fee schemes, causing market gains or losses and portfolio inflows or outflows to
overwhelm the impact of manager skill. Even though a number of managers offer superficially
attractive incentive compensation arrangements, three factors diminish the appeal of most
schemes. First, the vast bulk of marketable security funds generate profits primarily from asset-
based fees, encouraging managers to emphasize increasing asset totals. In other words, even
when firms offer incentive arrangements, those incentive arrangements fail to influence fund
manager behavior because investment firms continue to rely on fee income expressed as a
percentage of assets under management. Second, investment managers tend to offer terms on
incentive schemes that involve modest levels of risk to the firm's existing income flows. Instead
of taking a "blank slate" approach that sets baseline fees at a level that covers reasonable
overhead, money managers try to structure incentive arrangements that ensure continued
income flows even with mediocre performance, protecting the profit margins implicit in
existing fee structures. Finally, investors choosing between a traditional asset-based fee and an
alternative incentive-oriented structure encounter cognitive dissonance, as the performance
expectations implicit in hiring an active manager cause expected costs of incentive
compensation to exceed anticipated payments from a traditional asset-based fee arrangement.
While the concept of incentive compensation structures for active managers of marketable
securities carries a great deal of theoretical appeal, the limitations of real-world arrangements
reduce the effectiveness of incentive schemes in causing fund managers to behave as principals.
Investment management fees, whether asset-based or incentive-oriented, represent a heavily
scrutinized term in most contract negotiations, with investors seeking the lowest possible fee
burden along with a "most-favored-client" clause ensuring advantageous treatment in the
future. Beneath the open, honest discussion concerning marketable equity fee arrangements lic
hidden soft dollar payments, representing old-fashioned kickbacks designed to increase
investment advisor cash flow at the direct expense of investor clients.
Soft Dollars
The history of soft dollars provides a worrisome tale. Prior to May 1, 1975, Wall Street
operated under a system of fixed commissions that set rates far above the costs of executing
trades. Competitive forces caused brokerage firms to circumvent the fixed prices, by providing
rebates to favored customers in the form of soft dollars. Soft dollars, in essence a kickback from
broker to trader, funded the purchase of both investment-related and noninvestment-related
goods and services.
Think about the implications of soft-dollar trades for investors. Paying inflated
commissions to trade securities, for whatever purpose, reduces investment returns. The
reduction in return comes straight from the investor's pocket. The benefit, in the form of
goods and services, accrues directly to the fund manager. Because the costs of soft-dollar goods
and services would otherwise have come from the fund's management foc, soft dollars
represent nothing other than a well-disguised increase in management fees. Wall Street benefits
at the investor's expense.
AT. Rowe Price disclosure document, dated March 1, 2004, describes the soft-dollar game.
"[U]nder certain conditions, higher brokerage commissions may be paid in return for
brokerage and research services.... [S]uch services may include computers and related
hardware. T. Rowe Price also allocates brokerage for research services which are available for
cash.... [T]he expenses of T. Rowe Price could be materially inc lif it attempted to
generate additional information through its own staff. To the extent that research services of
value are provided by brokers or dealers, T. Rowe Price is relieved of expenses it might
otherwise bear." Investors learn of T. Rowe Price's soft-dollar policies through carefully
constructed, legally correct prose buried on pages 90 and 91 of an infrequently read disclosure
document. Even though T. Rowe Price presumably satisfies legal requirements with its
disclosure, the firm compromises investor interests with its soft-dollar usage.
After May Day 1975, when the SEC abolished the system of fixed commissions, the raison
d'être for soft dollars vanished. Price competition would set brokerage commission rates.
Under-the-table kick-backs could disappear. Unfortunately for investors, fund managers
realized that soft dollars transferred research-related expenses from their account (management
fee income) to the investors' account (trading expenses). As a result, the money management
industry enthusiastically defended the use of soft dollars.
Instead of banning soft dollars, in 1975 Congress created a safe harbor for their use under
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Perverting a piece of legislation originally
designed to protect the investing public, Congress bowed to pressure from Wall Street and
explicitly allowed fund managers to deplete investor assets, legitimizing soft dollars by
instructing the SEC to define appropriate use. Why do market participants tolerate the
inefficiencies involved in paying inflated prices for trading securities and then receiving rebates
in the form of goods and services? The answer lies in the lack of transparency of the process,
which allows money managers to profit in an opaque manner. Were the soft-dollar charges as
transparent as the highly visible management fees, the investment management industry would
have no use for soft dollars.
When the Securities and Exchange Commission examined the soft-dollar issue in the mid
1980s, the commission not only missed an opportunity to eliminate the scourge of soft dollars,
it actually expanded the epidemic. In wonderfully bureaucratic prose, the SEC noted that its
1986 release addressed "[i]ndustry difficulty in applying the restrictive standards" on soft-dollar
usage by "adopting a broader definition of 'brokerage and research services. In other words, if
the restrictions bind, loosen the constraints. The SEC's 1986 soft-dollar regulations favored the
advisor over the advisec.
SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt described soft dollar conflicts in a February 15, 1995 Wall
Street Journal article: "Soft-dollar arrangements can create substantial conflicts of interest
between an advisor and its clients. For example, advisors may cause their clients to pay excessive
commission rates, or may overtrade their clients' accounts simply to satisfy soft-dollar
obligations. Soft-dollar arrangements may also result in inferior executions when advisors
direct trades to the wrong broker to satisfy a soft-dollar obligation."39
To ameliorate conflicts surrounding brokerage activity, in February 1995, the SEC
proposed a new rule under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 that would require
investment managers to disclose the services they receive for brokerage commissions. The
report would list the twenty brokers to which the advisor directed the largest amounts of
commissions during the previous year, the top three execution-only brokers, the aggregate
amount of commissions directed by the advisor to each broker, and the average commission
rate paid to each broker. The disclosure would permit a client to assess the costs and benefits of
the soft-dollar services that the advisor receives, and, consequently, whether the client should
attempt to limit the advisor's use of soft-dollar brokers. Unfortunately, no action resulted from
the 1995 SEC rule proposal.
In spite of Chairman Levitt's public concerns about soft dollars, the SEC again failed to
protect mutual-fund investors in 1998. The regulator's Inspection Report dryly notes "the
widespread use of soft dollars," as "almost all advisors obtain products and services other than
pure execution from broker-dealers and use client commissions to pay for those products and
services." The report recognizes that "advisors using soft dollars face a conflict of interest
between their need to obtain research and their clients' interest in paying the lowest
commission rate available and obtaining the best possible execution." The report details
instance after instance of questionable use and outright abuse of soft dollars, including
payment "for office rent and equipm cellular phone services and personal pense
employee salaries, marketing expenses, legal fees, hotels and car rental costs." Wall Street's
definition of research bears little correspondence to Merriam-Webster's.
In spite of the fundamental, irreconcilable conflict of interest in soft-dollar use and in spite
of the long litany of soft-dollar abuse, the 1998 Inspection Report concludes only that the SEC
"should reiterate and provide additional guidance, consider adopting recordkeeping
requirements, require more meaningful disclosure and encourage firms to adopt internal
controls. Instead of protecting investor interests, the SEC defended Wall Street's gravy train.
While the substance of the 1998 Inspection Report argued for abolition, the SEC wimped
out. Faced with a concerted lobbying effort by interested parties-including investment
managers, Wall Street firms, and the normally sensible trade association of research analysts-
and a lack of pressure from individual investors, the self-styled "investor's advocate" opted to
tighten regulation instead of taking the high road of total eradication. A cynic might argue that
the SEC acts on highly visible, easy-to-understand investor protection issues, while allowing
low-profile, difficult-to-comprchend abuses to remain.
One of the most outrageous "legitimate" uses of soft dollars involves payoffs made by
investment advisors to consulting firms. According to the 1998 SEC report, performance
attribution services constitute "a significant portion of the total commission dollars used in
soft dollar transactions. "40 Obviously, any competent investment manager develops internal
capabilities to understand sources of investment returns, creating evaluation mechanisms
specific to the firm's particular approach to markets. Purchasing performance attribution from
consultants serves simply to line the pockets of the consulting firm at the expense of the
investment manager's clients. Presumably, the consulting firm receiving the payoff places the
investment management firm in a favored position when making manager recommendations.
While investment advisors may wish to improve their standing by purchasing useless
information from consulting firms, using client assets for the purpose turns inanity to
ignominy.
Some investment managers need so much assistance in evaluating performance that they
purchase reports from a variety of consultants. The SEC study cites a large institutional advisor
that "directed $882,000 in client commissions to pay for 13 separate performance analyses."
According to a report in Pensions and Investments, J&W Seligman & Co., a moncy
management firm with $24.3 billion under management, engaged seven consulting firms to
provide performance attribution reports, using client assets to fund the purchase through soft
dollars. By paying substantial sums to Callan Associates ($79,000), Evaluation Associates
($100,000), Frank Russell ($26,789), Madison Portfolio Consultants ($17,500), SEI
Corporation ($10,000), Wellesley Group ($52,500), and Yanni-Bilkey Investment Consulting
($25,000), J&W Seligman no doubt expects favorable treatment in the next search conducted
by the compromised consultants. Payoffs dishonor everyone involved.
Beyond the "legitimate" use of soft dollars to "curry favor with the consultant in his
rankings and recommendations of advisors," nearly 30 percent of investment advisors employ
soft dollars for "non-research products and services. The purchases, which fall outside of the
safe harbor, include use of soft dollars for office rent, equipment, marketing expenses, phone
services, and salaries. The SEC observed that "virtually all of the advisors that obtained non
research products and services had failed to provide meaningful disclosure of such practices to
their clients."42 Aside from using an illegitimate source of funds for legitimate business
expenses, many advisors stepped over another line by diverting funds for personal use,
including purchase of travel, entertainment, theatre tickets, limousine services, interior design,
Internet website design and construction, and computer hardware and software. In the most
flagrant abuse of soft dollars, investment advisors defrauded clients by directing "funds
ostensibly for verbal "regional research' and 'strategic planning' to family members of the
advisor's principal," by transferring soft dollars through a daisy chain of companies controlled
by the advisor's president, and by paying "round trip airfare to Hong Kong for the principal's
son. Even though soft dollars did not cause the theft, the opacity of the arrangement
facilitated the crimes.
Some clients benefit from a different aspect of the current system of commission-related
activity, taking advantage of the murky character of directed brokerage. With directed
brokerage, plan sponsors cause trades to be executed by specified brokers, paying higher than
market commission rates. A portion of the above-market rate flows back to the plan sponsor in
the form of cash rebates or investment-related goods and services. Two factors drive directed-
brokerage activity-directed-brokerage investors gain an advantage at the expense of clients not
directing brokerage, and fund sponsors use rebates from directed brokerage to purchase goods
and services unavailable through normal procurement channels.
Investment advisors commonly aggregate trades for a number of separate account clients,
allocating shares to accounts on a pro rata basis. If one client requests that brokerage be
directed to a particular securities firm, in order to receive a cash rebate, that client accrues an
unfair benefit relative to other clients. In fact, the client who "steps out of the aggregated
trade likely benefits implicitly from all of the brokerage conducted by the investment advisor at
the designated firm. Such arrangements exist only as long as they remain hidden from view. If
disclosed, disadvantaged clients would demand fair and equitable treatment.
Some investors, particularly in political or corporate environments, fail to obtain sufficient
direct support for investment management operations. To augment direct appropriations,
investments staff sometimes employ directed-brokerage and soft-dollar programs, generating
resources outside regular appropriations or operational channels.
Appearing before a Department of Labor Working Group on Soft Dollars and Commission
Recapture, the former director of the New Jersey Division of Investment openly testified that
"he utilizes soft dollars to pay for needed administrative expenses," since "he does not receive
sufficient funding from the New Jersey State Legislature." In fact, the former director urged
that "the current interpretation of research' should be expanded to include travel and hotel
expenses."43 Soft dollars provide a convenient mechanism for the New Jersey Division of
Investment to circumvent constraints imposed by the state legislature, allowing the investment
operation to thwart the intent of New Jersey's elected representatives.
In April 2007, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox added his voice to the chorus calling for
soft-dollar reform. In a speech to the Mutual Fund Directors Forum, Cox asserted that:
Soft dollars can serve as an incentive for fund managers to disregard their best execution
obligations, and also to trade portfolio securities inappropriately in order to earn credits
for research and brokerage. Soft dollars also represent a lot of investors' hard cash, even
though it isn't reported that way. The total of soft dollars runs into the billions each year
for all investment funds in the United States.
An agency focused on ensuring full disclosure to investors has to be very concerned
about this, because soft dollars make it more difficult for investors to understand what's
going on with their money. Hard dollars eventually end up being reported as part of the
management fee the fund charges its investors. But soft dollars provide a way for funds
to lower their apparent fees-even though, in the end, investors pay for the expense
anyway.
The very concept of soft dollars may be at odds with rity in describing fees and
costs to investors. The 30-year-old statutory safe harbor, in Section 28(e) of the
Exchange Act, was probably thought to be a useful legislative compromise when it was
packaged with the abolition of fixed commissions. But surely in enacting Section 28(e)
Congress meant to promote competition in research, not to create conflicts of interest
by permitting commission dollars to be spent in ways that benefit investment managers
instead of their investor clients,44
In May 2007, SEC Chairman Cox called for repeal or substantial revision of the safe harbor
that protects soft-dollar arrangements between broker dealers and money managers. Cox noted
the current system produced a "witch's brew of hidden fees, conflicts of interest and
complexity in application that is at odds with investors' best interests. "45
While the SEC attempts to reform soft-dollar practices, the question remains-why do soft
dollars exist? Powerful market participants in the brokerage community benefit from the
inherent murkiness of soft-dollar transactions. Third party providers of soft-dollar-eligible
goods and services maintain a strong vested interest in supporting the current system.
Investment advisors employing soft dollars increase net income by transferring a portion of
investment management costs to clients.
Soft-dollar activity flies in the face of reasonable governance. Investment advisors employ
soft dollars to pay off consulting firms and increase investment management revenues, relying
on the technique's opacity to hide from view. Fund managers incur frictional costs to pursue
initiatives with directed commissions for which "hard" dollars are unavailable, frustrating the
intentions of fund fiduciaries. Soft dollars and directed brokerage, the slimy underbelly of the
brokerage world, ought to be banned.
Compensation Arrangements for Nontraditional Assets
Fee arrangements in the nontraditional asset arena typically include some form of profits
interest. In spite of important limitations, when compared to typical marketable security deal
terms, alternative asset deal structures better align interests of fund managers and fund
providers, as the profits interest focuses manager attention on generating investment gains.
Large co-investment by managers provides the strongest force for creating parallel interests,
causing the manager to share in investment losses as well as in investment gains. Forcing
managers to pay attention to the downside of an investment mitigates concerns about the one-
way nature of profit sharing options.
Without substantial levels of co-investment, deal structures in the alternative arena
encourage investment managers to expose investor assets to risk, as the managers typically
receive compensation in the form of an option-like profits interest. Facing a "heads I win, tails
you lose" arrangement, managers respond by adopting an agent's perspective, focusing on
achieving personal gains that may or may not correspond to generating risk-adjusted
investment returns for the providers of capital.
A particularly troublesome problem results from granting investment managers a profits
interest without specifying an appropriate benchmark or hurdle rate. By paying 20 percent of
gains after return of capital, investors give asset managers a windfall in the form of a profit
participation in market-generated gains over which the manager exercises no control. In
creating structures without a reasonable measure of the opportunity cost of funds, investors
diminish the likelihood of realizing superior risk-adjusted returns.
Alternative asset compensation arrangements consist of fee income, generally calculated on
portfolio value or committed capital, and incentive schemes, generally calculated as a portion
of investment gains. In the rarely achieved ideal world, fees offset ordinary costs of pursuing the
investment business, while profits interests create incentives for adding value to the process. All
too frequently, fees exceed the level required to cover costs, becoming a profit center, and profit
participations cover more than value added, rewarding (or penalizing) managers for results
beyond their control.
Fee Income
Reasonable fee income provides sufficient revenue to cover a firm's overhead, allowing
investors to run the business comfortably. Investment principals deserve fair salaries, nicely
appointed offices, and sufficient resources to structure and manage the portfolio. Ideally,
investors would discuss with fund managers the level of resources required to operate the firm,
setting a budget sufficient to meet the agreed-upon needs. In practice, few firms take a
budgeted approach to setting fees. Most firms maintain industry-standard fee percentages as
fund sizes grow and generate enormous cash flows simply from raising ever larger funds.
Deal fees, paid to private fund managers upon consummation of an acquisition, serve to
line the pockets of fund managers at the direct expense of investors. Typically found in the
leveraged buyout arena, such fees motivate firms to do deals and provide an unnecessary
addition to the more-than-generous compensation package represented by management fees
and carried interests. Fees in excess of those required to run the business drive a wedge between
the interests of investors and fund managers, subtly shifting the manager's focus to
maintaining fees at the expense of generating returns.
Profits Interests
Incentive compensation in the form of a share of gains generated by fund investments provides
a powerful tool to motivate fund managers. A fair and effective arrangement splits the value
added by the fund manager between the manager and the investor. Both parties deserve to
share in incremental gains, since without the manager's work there would be no value added,
while without the investor's capital there would be no deal. Achieving a hurdle rate that reflects
the investor's opportunity cost of capital represents the point at which a fund manager begins
to add value. Unfortunately, in much of the private equity world, hurdles do not exist. By
providing profits interests after return of capital, investors compensate fund managers
inappropriately. Incentive compensation in the form of sharing value added causes managers to
pursue the active investor's goal of creating risk-adjusted excess returns.
A particularly egregious deal structure causes investors to pay incentive compensation to
fund managers before the return of invested capital. Under some private equity arrangements,
the investor's capital account declines by the amount of management fees paid. If "gains" are
calculated off of the reduced base, fund managers may receive a profits interest on a fund that
fails to return investor capital. At the very least, fund managers ought to return investor capital
before reaping the significant rewards of incentive compensation.
Fairness demands that investors earn hard hurdles before profit sharing begins. Hard
hurdles represent rates of return that investors realize before fund managers participate in
gains, with only profits above the hurdle rate subject to sharing. Soft hurdles, a popular
marketing scheme, allow fund managers to "catch up" after exceeding the hurdle rate,
providing little value for investors (except in the case where a manager produces truly miserable
returns).
Identifying an appropriate hurdle rate poses a tricky problem, since alternative markets lack
a ready benchmark such as the S&P 500 for marketable domestic equities. In the case of
absolute return, the cost of funds as expressed by a one-year interest rate provides a reasonable
starting point. Since absolute return managers generally take short duration positions,
measuring investment success relative to short-term interest rates makes sense. In the case of
real assets, where expected returns fall between bonds (representing a lower risk measure of an
institution's opportunity cost of funds) and stocks (representing a higher risk measure of
opportunity cost), intermediate-term fixed income returns plus a small premium might give us
an appropriate hurdle. When forming new funds, investors and fund managers revisit the
question of an appropriate hurdle rate in light of changes in market conditions. For instance, as
interest rates moved downward throughout the 1990s, appropriate real assets hurdle rates
declined from high single digits to mid single digits.
In contrast to reasonable deal structures sometimes available to investors in absolute return
and real assets, investors in venture capital and leveraged buyouts face generally unattractive
partnership terms. By compensating private equity managers with 20 percent, 25 percent, or
30 percent of every dollar generated after return of capital, standard profit sharing
arrangements fail to consider the opportunity cost of capital. At the very least, private
managers ought to return a money market rate before collecting a profits interest. The long-
term return on a marketable equity benchmark provides a hurdle rate more appropriate to the
risk of private equity. In fact, the higher risk inherent in venture capital and leveraged buyout
investments suggests using a multiple of long-term equity returns as a threshold for
benchmarking private equity funds.
Risk-adjusted marketable security hurdle rates for private investments avoid the problem of
compensating (or penalizing) fund managers for market moves that they cannot control. In the
bull market of the 1980s and 1990s, buyout managers "earned" 20 percent of the profits on
gains attributable to stock-market-induced valuation increases. In a reasonable world, investors
might compensate private managers with a profits interest in returns exceeding some premium
over long-run historical results from marketable equity investments, implying a mid-teens
hurdle rate.
Fair incentive compensation schemes for alternative asset managers face nearly
insurmountable obstacles. Under the current conditions of overwhelming demand for high
quality groups, investors lack power to influence terms, facing the choice of accepting the
standard deal or walking away. Investors hoping to encourage fund managers to behave as
principals look to other aspects of deal structure.
Absolute Return Investment Vehicles
Absolute return managers, operating in a marketable securities environment, generally allow
investors to withdraw assets and to make contributions on a reasonably frequent basis.
Although partnership terms generally restrict the timing and size of inflows and outflows,
stable investors face the possibility of incurring costs created by other investors' cash moving in
and out. Cash contributions to an existing partnership dilute the interest of existing investors.
By buying into an existing commingled fund, new investors participate in an established
portfolio without paying transactions costs to establish positions. Cash withdrawals pose the
same free rider problem as departing monies fail to bear the full burden of trading costs
required to raise the cash necessary to compensate departing investors.
A more significant problem arises when cash outflows disrupt a manager's investment
strategy. During the market panic in late 1998, many hedge fund managers worried about the
magnitude of year-end withdrawals. The threat of potentially large withdrawals posed a
dilemma, as on the one hand managers needed to prepare to accommodate departing investor
demands while on the other hand asset sales at depressed prices harm the portfolio. The
confluence of tough market conditions and concern regarding client withdrawals caused many
managers to raise cash by selling assets trading at temporarily depressed prices, impairing results
for the manager and steadfast investors alike.
Fund managers solve the free rider problem by allocating costs appropriately to entering
and exiting investors. In the case of easily measured transactions costs, managers simply assess
entry and exit fees, resulting in a fair allocation of costs. To meet the objective of distributing
costs fairly, fees must be paid to the fund, not to the manager, as the fees offset costs incurred
by the fund. More complicated procedures address the issue of allocating less predictable costs,
particularly charges from transactions conducted in markets with poor liquidity. A rough
approximation of fairness results from segregating new investor contributions, investing the
funds, and contributing the resulting assets to the general portfolio at cost. Even though the
package of securities purchased by the entering investor may not bear precisely the same level of
transactions costs as would trades in existing portfolio securities, if the manager makes new
purchases in markets similar to the existing holdings the new entrant bears a fair burden. Upon
exit, the departing investor receives a pro rata share of the general portfolio in a segregated
account, incurring the transactions costs associated with the liquidation process and insulating
continuing investors from any adverse impact. By causing entering and exiting investors to
absorb costs related to purchases and sales, fund managers avoid unfair treatment of existing
investors. Most importantly, the process allows managers to invest assets without regard to
concerns regarding extraordinary withdrawal requests, since departing investors simply receive
the proceeds of their proportionate share of the fund.
Private Equity Investment Vehicles
Private equity managers best serve investor interests by focusing undivided attention on a
single investment vehicle. With only one place to conduct business, managers avoid the
inevitable conflicts that arise when managing multiple funds with non-coincident goals.
For example, if a buyout firm manages an equity pool and a mezzanine debt pool, tensions
arise in pricing transactions. Better pricing on the mezzanine debt leads to worse results for the
equity holders, and vice versa. Some firms attempt to deal with pricing issues by creating a
formula for determining the terms of mezzanine finance. By pre-specifying the relationship
between the mezzanine coupon level and U.S. Treasury rates, as well as pre-identifying the size
of the equity kicker for the bondholders, fund managers hope to avoid the tricky issues
involved in dividing expected returns between competing sets of investors.
Because dynamic market conditions constantly alter terms of trade for various investment
tools, formulaic approaches inevitably fail to reflect the current market. If the formula
determines worse-than-market terms for mezzanine debt, fund managers fail to discharge
fiduciary duties to mezzanine investors. If the formula results in a better-than-market deal,
equity investors suffer. The convenience of controlling a captive mezzanine fund comes at the
cost of a serious conflict between the interests of lenders and owners. In the event of financial
distress, problems become even more painfully obvious with some members of the firm
wearing mezzanine hats and others wearing equity hats. If equity owners seek forbearance from
lenders, fund managers find themselves in a hopelessly conflicted position. The best course for
bondholders frequently differs from the path preferred by equity owners, posing a dilemma for
even the best intentioned fund manager. In the case of bankruptcy, the problems worsen as
interests clash in the zero-sum game of allocating value to debt and equity. By creating and
managing multiple funds, managers invite exposure to the crossways pull of competing
interests.
While debt and equity funds provide a dramatic example of tensions arising from
management of multiple funds, complementary activities create similar types of issues. Criteria
that determine which fund receives a particular transaction, carefully delineated in the fund
offering documents, frequently fail to address subsequent realities, creating messy allocation
issues for fund managers. Perhaps even more important, the fund manager faces the daily
problem of deciding which particular activity will receive the manager's time and attention.
Because multiple funds contain different sets of investors with different interests, in choosing
which activities to pursue the fund manager decides which set of investors to serve.
Fund manager investment outside of investment pools deserves careful scrutiny. Investment
principals must avoid doing private deals for their own account, even if the transactions seem
too small, too funky, or otherwise inappropriate for the institutional fund. Investors deserve
the complete dedication of fund manager investment efforts. Undiluted focus of all
professional energies on the management of a single investment pool forms an important
starting point in serving investment client needs.
KKR's Deal Structure Flaws
Poorly structured private investment deals often produce dramatically misaligned interests.
The well known buyout firm, Kohlberg, Kravis, & Roberts (KKR), negotiated partnership
terms in its 1993 fund that enriched the principals regardless of the results for the limited
partners. Like managers of most private equity funds, KKR received a carried interest of 20
percent of the partnership's profits. Unlike most funds, KKR did not aggregate investments
when calculating the profits interest. That is, KKR collected 20 percent of the profits on
successful deals, with no offset for losses incurred in failed transactions, creating an incentive to
roll the dice. KKR owned a share of the profits of big wins, but suffered none of the pain of big
losses. In essence, the deal structure encouraged the firm to take enormous risk by creating
option-like payoffs for the general partners through use of extreme financial or operating
leverage.
KKR's sagreement with the limited partners called for a management fee of 1.5 percent of
assets, typical of leveraged buyout partnerships. Such management fees, designed to cover the
cost of running a buyout fund's business, became a profit center for KKR because of the
enormous size of funds under supervision. Not satisfied with excessive management fees, KKR
collected deal fees for consummating transactions, monitoring fees for managing positions and
investment banking fees for subsequent capital market transactions. The overly generous
management fees, deal fees, monitoring fees, and investment banking fees drive a wedge
between the interests of the general partners (more is better) and the limited partners (less is
more). Contrast this with the terms of Warren Buffett's original partnership, in which he
charged no management fee, believing that he should only profit if his co-investors profited!46
KKR's August 1995 purchase of Bruno's illustrates the misaligned interests. The $1.2
billion transaction, which included an equity investment of $250 million, involved the
acquisition of a chain of supermarkets headquartered in Mississippi. KKR charged an
acquisition fee of $15 million, which exceeded the general partners' investment by a significant
margin. Pro-rated management fees, charged on committed capital, amounted to $3.75 million
on an annual basis. The monitoring fee consumed an additional $1 million annually.
Moreover, in 1997 KKR charged Bruno's investment banking fees of $800,000. In exchange
for financing the purchase and paying tens of millions of dollars of fees, in February 1998, the
limited partners lost their entire investment when Bruno's declared bankruptcy, filing for
Chapter XI.
Properly structured deals cause general partners and limited partners to share in both profits
and losses. If a managing agent shares only in profits, incentives to take risk abound.
Management fee income that covers only overhead forces investors to perform before receiving
extraordinary profits. Fees above the basic overhead level represent an undeserved transfer from
limited partners to general partners. The combination of high levels of fee income and option-
like payoff structure allowed KKR to profit unreasonably on the Bruno's deal, while the firm's
investors wrote off the transaction.
Some aspects of the unusually egregious fee structure employed by KKR disappeared in
1996, when the firm raised a then-market-leading $5.7 billion fund. Pressured by substantial
institutional investors, the buyout firm agreed to aggregate the results of all deals in the fund,
offsetting deficits from losers before taking profits on winners. While KKR's investors expect
to benefit from the pooling of transaction results, the firm continues to benefit from
extraordinary levels of fee income, ensuring general partner success regardless of limited partner
investment results.
KKR's fee income in 2006 illustrates the role of fees in the stunning transfer of wealth from
limited partners to general partners. According to the July 3, 2007 preliminary S-1 filed with
the SEC to facilitate KKR's proposed IPO, in 2006 the firm received $67 million in monitoring
fees and $273 million in transaction fees. Harvard Business School Professor Josh Lerner
estimates that fund management fees in 2006 amounted to approximately $350 million.47
KKR's senior professionals, who reportedly numbered twenty-five, collected an estimated $690
million in fees simply for showing up, turning on the lights, and going about their day-to-day
business.
In spite of KKR's 1996 removal of the deal-by-deal incentive compensation clause, investors
generally exercise little influence over deal terms, as investment managers hew to an industry
standard scale that provides higher levels of income at lower risk than would a fair
compensation structure. Consider an environment where managers receive base fees to cover
reasonable overhead and earn a portion of excess returns to provide incentive. Since a majority
of market participants fail to beat a fair risk-adjusted benchmark, most fund managers would
face a substantial decline in income under a fair deal structure.
Because profits interests begin to accrue after return of capital, private managers collect
incentive compensation after investors receive a zero rate of return. If private managers received
a profits interest in gains only above a risk-adjusted benchmark, based on historical results the
overwhelming number of managers would fail to earn incentive compensation. Because the
investment management industry receives compensation far in excess of levels justified by the
degree of value created, investors encounter enormous resistance to institution of reasonable
deal structures.
Unfortunately, when altering the terms of the trade, investors face the challenge of making
industry-wide changes, since manager-by-manager change introduces the potential for
instability. If a single private equity manager promoted a fair deal structure, compensation for
that firm's principals would fall far short of industry standards. Personnel at the firm could
cross the street, work for a private fund operating under the unfair profit sharing regime,
thereby increasing personal income dramatically. The innovative private fund, offering a fair
deal, retains only those principals without other alternatives.
Investors find terms of trade in the private equity arena moving away from fairness. Fees on
multibillion-dollar buyout funds generate tens of millions of dollars per annum, far in excess of
amounts necessary to fund reasonable levels of partnership operating expenses. Buyout fund
profits interests take 20 percent of returns created by the stock market's upward bias, not to
mention 20 percent of returns produced by highly leveraged capital structures. After adjusting
for fees, profits interests, and the risk, no excess return remains for the overwhelming number
of capital providers.
Venture capital investors fare little better. In the past, the venture community fell into a neat
three-tier structure with Kleiner Perkins atop the hierarchy earning a 30 percent profits
interest, a handful of superb firms receiving a 25 percent carry, and the rest of the industry
taking home 20 percent of gains. The late 1990s Internet mania turned many solid venture
capitalists into bull market geniuses, causing them to demand an increase in compensation
from 20 percent of profits to 25 percent or even 30 percent. While a few making the move
deserve inclusion in the elite ranks of the industry, most simply say "it's the market" or "we
need to do it for competitive reasons." Such top-of-the-market increases in compensation
persisted through the subsequent period of weak venture returns, creating a pattern one-way
ratcheting of deal terms against investor interests.
A recent study by two Wharton School academics, Andrew Met-rick and Ayako Yasuda,
produced some startling results regarding the relationship between fee income and profits
interests. The authors examined detailed records of 238 funds raised between 1992 and 2006.
Based on their modeling of the partnership characteristics, "about 60 percent of expected
revenue comes from fixed-revenue components which are not sensitive to performance."48 The
conclusion that the majority of general partner compensation takes the form of fee income calls
in question the basic private equity partnership structure.
Michael Jensen, professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School, expressed concerns
about private equity compensation schemes in a September 2007 interview with the New York
Times's Gretchen Morgenson. Jensen, "the man whom many consider to be the intellectual
father of private equity," "deplores the newfangled fees that private equity firms are levying on
their clients." Jensen said, "I can predict without a shred of doubt that these fees are going to
end up reducing the productivity of the model. And it creates another wedge between the
outsiders and insiders, which is very, very serious. People are doing this out of some short-run
focus on increasing revenues, and not paying attention to what the strengths of the model
are. "49 Investors in private equity fare best with smaller, more entrepreneurial fund managers
that benefit less from fees and more from profit participation.
Negotiating Change
While long established practices limit the ability of investors to negotiate fair deal terms, in the
early 1990s the real estate industry presented an opportunity for radical restructuring. After
recklessly throwing staggering amounts of capital into real estate in the 1980s, institutions
withdrew almost completely from the market after the turn-of-the-decade collapse in prices.
Those few investors interested in committing funds faced a host of unattractive investment
management alternatives.
Large fee-driven advisors dominated institutional real estate activity in the 1980s. Firms
such as AEW, Copley, Heitman, JMB, LaSalle, RREEF, and TCW amassed billions of dollars
in assets, driven by the steady stream of acquisition fees, management fees, and disposition fees.
Not surprisingly, the real estate advisory community adopted a laser-like focus on initiating,
maintaining and enhancing flows of fee income, often neglecting even to consider the notion
of generating investment returns for clients.
JMB's Fee Bonanza
Headquartered in Chicago and named for Robert Judelson, Judd Malkin, and Neil Bluhm,
JMB typified the fee orientation of the 1980s advisory crowd. Not content to collect flows of
income based on the fair value of client assets, the firm went to extraordinary lengths to collect
its fees even as portfolio assets withered in the 1990s real estate collapse.
Exhibiting nearly unbelievable greed, JMB retained underwater positions simply to collect
fees from clients. In July 1986, the firm acquired Argyle Village Square, a retail property in
Jacksonville, Florida, for $22 million as part of a portfolio of properties held in a commingled
fund, Endowment and Foundation Realty-JMB II. Encumbered by a mortgage of $12.4
million, the property generated fees for JMB of 1.25 percent on the gross value of the asset,
equivalent to nearly 2.3 percent on the original equity investment.
By 1992, Argyle Village Square declined in value to the extent that the property's mortgage
exceeded its market price. The anchor tenant, discount department store Zayre's, vacated its
space, dramatically impairing the property's future prospects. Instead of turning the shopping
center over to the lender, JMB held the asset on its books at zero equity value, continuing to
collect fees from investors based on the gross value of the property. With a cash return of 1.1
percent (after debt service and before fees), Argyle Village Square's fee of 1.25 percent exceeded
the property's income. To add injury to insult, JMB used investor cash flow from other assets
to make up the difference, ensuring the continued flow of the full level of fees to the firm. In
spite of repeated requests from investors to dispose of Argyle Village and stop the diversion of
portfolio cash flow to pay fees, JMB retained the shopping center and piggily fed at the trough
of investor assets.
In the largest real estate acquisition ever," JMB's 1987 purchase of Cadillac Fairview, a
collection of Canadian retailing properties, generated a fee bonanza for the firm on a
stupendous scale.50 Continuing its practice of assessing fees on the gross value of transactions,
JMB's initial fee amounted to one percent of the C$6.8 billion deal, representing a load of 3.4
percent on original equity contributions of approximately C$2.0 billion. JMB included in the
gross transaction valuc a portfolio of assets worth approximately C$560 million already under
contract for sale, causing the firm to "carn" C$5.6 million for acquiring and immediately
selling assets with absolutely no potential to benefit investors.
JMB's "feeing" frenzy continued with annual asset management fees of 0.5 percent per year
on gross fair market value (equivalent to 1.7 percent of initial equity), participation fees of 1.75
percent per year on cash flow and capital proceeds, and disposition fees of 1.0 percent on gross
proceeds (with a parenthetical reminder in the Offering Memorandum that gross proceeds
includes indebtedness," in case the investor forgot).
In addition to initial fees, annual fees, participation fees, and disposition fees, JMB retained
the right to provide property management, leasing, insurance brokerage, and other services
with compensation negotiated on an "arms-length" basis. Not satisfied with the staggering
array of fee-generating opportunities, JMB contracted to receive incentive fees of 15 percent of
profits after providing a 9 percent simple annual return to investors.
Unfortunately for JMB and its co-investors in Cadillac Fairview, in the tough environment
of the early 1990s, the overpriced, overleveraged buyout suffered. Notwithstanding an
additional 1992 equity contribution of C$700 million, by 1994 interests representing the
C$2.7 billion of equity contributed by investors traded at 20 cents to 25 cents on the dollar. As
pension investors from California, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Iowa watched the relentless
decline in asset valuc, JMB continued to collect its management fees.
Responding to outrage over the real estate advisor's insulation from the failure of the
Canadian mega-deal, JMB voluntarily reduced its annual fee from $30 million to $25 million,
while noting that the fee compensated the firm for advising Cadillac Fairview, not the
investors! Judd Malkin highlighted the lack of coincidence of interest with his investors,
observing that "[i]f I cut my fees by one-half, it still doesn't change their return."51
Succumbing to the inevitable consequence of too much debt and too little cash flow, in
December 1994, Cadillac Fairview filed for protection from creditors in Canadian bankruptcy
court. In spite of the failure of the company and massive losses by its investors, JMB
aggressively sought to retain the gravy train, suing Cadillac Fairview for C$225 million, of
which C$180 million represented the future stream of fees for advising the company on its
Canadian properties. JMB settled the fee claim for C$22.5 million in 1995.
In spite of the massive failure of Cadillac Fairview and JMB's outrageous treatment of
investors, Neil Bluhm raised another institutional fund, Walton Street Capital, in 1997. The
original fund paved the way for a series of funds, which as of 2007 boasted $3.5 billion of
aggregate equity commitments. Bluhm's asset-gathering ability and fee-charging acumen
created a net worth sufficient to merit a rank of 215 on the 2006 Forbes' list of the 400
wealthiest Americans. $2
While JMB may represent the worst of the fee-driven excesses, in the 1980s all major real
estate advisors focused on collecting fees, not generating investment returns. Institutions
hoping to exploit real estate opportunities in the early 1990s faced a collection of discredited
advisors operating with fundamentally flawed deal structures. Fortunately, an almost total
withdrawal of capital from the real estate market provided substantial negotiating leverage to
investors willing to commit funds to the cash-starved asset class.
The capital drought of the early 1990s placed investors and real estate fund managers on equal
footing, allowing negotiation of fair deal terms. Providers of funds negotiated management
fees sufficient to cover overhead, but insufficient to create a profit center. Investors obtained a
hard hurdle, forcing managers to provide a fair return before earning a profits interest. In cases
where real estate managers enjoyed a substantial net worth, general partner commitments to
funds amounted to tens of millions of dollars, often exceeding the contributions made by
many of the limited partners. When managers exhibited more modest means, recourse loans
from the partnership provided funds for the manager's co-investment.
The dearth of capital in the early 1990s created an unusual opportunity for investors to alter
the compensation arrangements for real estate investing. Moving from the dysfunctional fee-
driven agency structure of the 1980s to a well-aligned investment-return-oriented principal
structure in the 1990s promoted the interests of investors and fund managers alike.
While the return of capital to real estate investing in the late 1990s croded some of the deal
structure gains, many managers chose to continue employing principal-oriented structures
even when presented with rich fee-driven opportunities. Aside from purely economic
considerations, the loyalty engendered by previous successful pursuit of mutually rewarding
investment activities contributed materially to the decision to continue working with the
existing structure. The dislocations in the real estate markets contributed to long lasting
changes in institutional deal terms.
CONCLUSION
Market efficiency creates substantial hurdles for investors pursuing active management
strategies, causing most to fail even to match results of market benchmarks. Although trying to
beat the market proves tough and costly, fiduciaries frequently accept active manager claims at
face value, attribute investment success to skill (not luck), and fail to adjust results for risk. In
the face of active management obstacles, market players respond to the thrills and excitement
generated by playing a game with scores tallied in the millions, and even billions, explaining the
nearly universal pursuit of active strategies by institutional investors.
Thoughtful investors approach active management opportunities with great skepticism,
starting with the presumption that managers exhibit no skill. Historical performance numbers
deserve careful scrutiny, with astute observers mindful of the part good fortune plays in
successful track records. Odds of winning the active management game increase when
committing funds to managers possessing an "edge" likely to produce superior performance in
extremely competitive markets.
Selecting the right people to manage assets poses the single biggest challenge to fiduciaries,
since integrity, intelligence, and energy influence portfolio outcomes in the most fundamental
manner. The actions of external managers contribute not only to investment performance, but
also to the reputation and public perception of the institution itself, forcing fiduciaries to
embrace extremely high standards in manager selection.
Appropriate organizational structure plays a part in successful execution of investment
programs by ensuring sufficient alignment of interest between the institutional fund and the
external advisor. Independent investment advisors with carefully structured economic
incentives stand the greatest chance of producing high risk-adjusted returns, as appropriate
incentives cause managers to place institutional goals ahead of personal agendas. While
thoughtful deal terms and sensible organizational attributes contribute to the likelihood of
success, even the most carefully constructed arrangements fail when implemented by the
wrong people.
Entrepreneurial firms provide the greatest likelihood of dealing successfully with ever
changing market dynamics, ultimately increasing the chances of delivering superior investment
returns. Unfortunately, successful firms contain the seeds of their own destruction, as size
inhibits performance and age saps energy. Vigilant fiduciaries stand ready to cull the old and
tired, while identifying the new and energetic.
Deal structure plays a critical role in shaping the behavior of investment managers and
determining the fairness of investment gain and loss allocations. By encouraging asset managers
to behave as principals, appropriate deal terms cause investors to seek investment gains and de-
emphasize return-reducing streams of fee income.
Typical compensation arrangements cause asset manager income to depend on factors
beyond the investment advisor's control. As bull market gains inflate marketable security
portfolios and increase private fund assets, managers benefit through enhanced management
fees and profits interests. Bear market losses impose costs unrelated to manager actions. In the
case of both marketable and private deal structures, investment advisors' compensation waxes
and wanes with the market's fortunes, resulting in carnings streams not directly tied to the level
of value created.
By operating under asset-based compensation arrangements that fail to consider value-
added measures, investment managers lose focus on return generation, emphasizing instead a
stay-in-business strategy designed to protect streams of fee income. Partly as a consequence of
poor deal structure, standard compensation arrangements allocate investment gains and losses
unfairly, frequently enriching the investment manager while generating substandard risk-
adjusted returns to providers of funds.
Appropriate deal terms serve to encourage fund managers to behave as principals, causing
them to pursue gains while avoiding losses. Structural characteristics that play an important
role in aligning investment manager and investor interests include the nature of the investment
vehicle, level of fees, form of incentive compensation, and size of manager co-investment. By
secking investment arrangements that motivate managers to pursue high levels of risk-adjusted
portfolio gains, investors encourage a focus on generating satisfactory investment results.
Investors hoping to beat the odds by playing the game of active management face daunting
obstacles ranging from the efficiency in pricing of most marketable securities to the burden of
extraordinary fees in most alternative asset investment vehicles. Only by identifying extremely
high quality people operating in an appropriately structured organization do active investors
create an opportunity to add value to the investment process. Painstaking identification,
careful structuring, and patient implementation of investment management relationships
provide essential underpinnings to an active management program.10
Investment Process
Structuring a portfolio consistent with fundamental investment tenets requires a governance
process that produces an appropriate policy portfolio, avoids counterproductive market
timing, and identifies effective investment management relationships. One of the most critical
portfolio management decisions concerns the choice between (a) developing an organization
with the capability of selecting high quality active managers, and (b) deploying a strategy with
an emphasis on bare bones passive vehicles. While choosing an active approach broadens the
asset class opportunity set and holds the promise of market-beating returns, active strategies
demand a significant commitment of resources. Those institutions that engage in active
management without proper support face the unpalatable prospect of generating
disappointing results for themselves and creating opportunities for better prepared investors.
Two important tencts of investment management-contrarian thinking and long-term
orientation-pose challenges for governance of endowment funds. Because large bureaucratic
organizations invariably use groups of people (investment committees) to oversee other groups
of people (investment staff), consensus-building behavior permeates the investment process.
Unless carefully managed, group dynamics frequently thwart contrarian activities and impose
shorter than optimal time horizons. Creating a governance process that encourages long-term,
independent, contrarian thinking represents a critical undertaking for endowed institutions.
John Maynard Keynes, in The General Theory, describes the difficulties inherent in group
investment decision making: "Finally it is the long-term investor, he who most promotes the
public interest, who will in practice come in for most criticism, wherever investment funds are
managed by committees or boards or banks. For it is the essence of his behavior that he should
be eccentric, unconventional, and rash in the eyes of average opinion. If he is successful, that
will only confirm the general belief in his rashness; and if in the short run he is unsuccessful,
which is very likely, he will not receive much mercy. Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for
reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally." The challenges facing an
institution attempting to structure effective governance processes center on exercising
appropriate fiduciary oversight, while encouraging "eccentric, unconventional, and rash"
behavior.
ACTIVE versus PASSIVE MANAGEMENT
Perhaps, the most important distinguishing characteristic of an investor concerns the ability
(or lack thereof) to make high quality active management decisions. Skillful active investors
sensibly employ a broader set of asset class alternatives, enriching opportunities for portfolio
diversification. Adept active investors pursue market-beating strategies in marketable securities,
potentially enhancing asset class returns. The active investor enjoys the greatest opportunity to
create and implement portfolios with high potential returns and low prospective risks.
The surest path to making effective active management decisions comes from engaging a
highly qualified staff of professionals committed to serving the interests of the investment
fund. A dedicated staff supplies the resources necessary to identify the exceedingly rare group
of managers able to add value in the investment process. In addition, hiring a group of
individuals to manage a particular investment fund reduces the severity of the principal-agent
conflicts that pervade the money management industry, as the staff serves as a strong advocate
for the institution's interests.
Investors without the resources to make well-informed active management judgments
sensibly limit portfolio choices to passively managed, broad-based asset classes of marketable
securities, including domestic equity, foreign developed equity, emerging market equity, real
estate investment trusts, U.S. Treasury bonds and U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.
The intensely competitive investment world inevitably punishes casual attempts to beat the
market, leading the rational resource-constrained investor to employ a manageable set of low-
cost passive alternatives.
Certain asset classes require active management skills if the investor hopes to realize an
attractive risk-adjusted outcome: absolute return, real assets, and private equity. In each case,
no market exists for the investor to buy; active management proves critical to producing
acceptable results. In each case, fee arrangements-the combination of an asset-based
management fee and a profits interest-create a substantial hurdle for investment success and
provide dramatic punishment for investors who fail. In cach case, in large part because of the
generous fee arrangements, median asset class returns fail to provide satisfactory risk-adjusted
returns to providers of capital. In each case, identifying managers with substantial potential
involves a broad range of qualitative and quantitative skills. Success in absolute return, real
assets, and private equity depends critically on high quality active management decisions.
Aside from allowing investors to effectively use a broader set of asset classes, a high quality
team of professionals enables an institution to seek market-beating results in the relatively
efficiently priced marketable securities arena. Even though low cost, passive alternatives provide
a high hurdle for active managers, with diligent investigation and a sufficiently long time
horizon, top-notch investment professionals face reasonable prospects of producing superior
active management records.
The role of active management takes center stage in deliberations regarding the structure of
the investment organization and governance of the investment process. Institutions that create
well-staffed, high quaility investment organizations with effective committee oversight enjoy
the opportunity to employ a broader range of asset classes and exploit an intriguing set of
market inefficiencies. Institutions without substantial staff resources sensibly follow a strategy
limited to passively managed portfolios. The choice between the active and the passive
approaches to portfolio management carries implications for nearly every aspect of the
investment process.
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
To produce a high quaility, actively managed portfolio, investment management organizations
require a strong staff overseen by a well-functioning investment committee. Effective
investment committees provide appropriate oversight while taking care not to impinge on staff
responsibilities. Limiting committee meetings to four per year prevents trustees from becoming
too involved in day-to-day portfolio management decisions, yet allows staff to receive
appropriate guidance from the committee. By presuming that initiatives come from staff, not
from committee members, responsibility for the nature and direction of the investment
program rests squarely on the shoulders of the investment office. In short, the investment
committee should play the role of a board of directors for the fund management operation.
Investment Committee
A strong investment committee brings discipline to the endowment management process. By
thoroughly and thoughtfully vetting investment recommendations, the committee inspires
staff to produce ever more carefully considered proposals. Ideally, committees rarely exercise
the power to reject staff recommendations. If a committee frequently turns down or revises
investment proposals, the staff encounters difficulty in managing the portfolio. Investment
opportunities often require negotiation of commitments subject to board approval. If the
board withholds approval with any degree of regularity, staff loses credibility in the eyes of the
investment management community. That said, the committee must provide more than a
rubber stamp for staff recommendations. In a well run organization, committee discussion of
investment proposals influences the direction and nature of future staff initiatives. Effective
portfolio management requires striking a balance between respect for the ultimate authority of
the investment committee and delegation of reasonable responsibility to the investment staff.
Committee members often provide assistance between meetings, providing feedback on
past actions and suggesting strategies for the future. Informed give and take elevates the
investment dialog, challenging staff and committee to improve the quality of investment
decision making.
Investment committee members should be selected primarily for good judgment. While no
particular background qualifics an individual to serve on the committee, broad understanding
of financial markets proves useful in overseeing the investment process. Aggregating a
collection of investment specialists occasionally poses dangers, particularly when committee
members attempt to manage the portfolio, not the process. Successful executives bring a
valuable perspective to the table provided they suspend their natural inclination to reward
success and punish failure. The sometimes deep rooted corporate instinct to pursue winners
and avoid losers pushes portfolios toward fundamentally risky momentum-driven strategies
and away from potentially profitable contrarian opportunities. The most effective investment
committee members understand the responsibility to oversee the investment process and to
provide support for the investment staff, while avoiding actual management of the portfolio.
Investment Staff
Strong investment staffs drive the portfolio management process. Whether dealing with broad
issues of asset allocation and spending policy or specific issues of portfolio management and
manager selection, the staff needs to make a rigorous, compelling case for adopting a particular
course of action. Advocacy must not compromise disclosure, as actual and potential
weaknesses need to be fully described and discussed. Intellectual dishonesty ultimately proves
fatal to the investment process.
Without a disciplined process for articulating investment recommendations, decision
making tends to become informal, even casual. In the case of asset allocation decisions, effective
staff analysis establishes and articulates a coherent, intellectual framework from which well-
grounded recommendations flow. In the case of individual manager decisions, a rigorous
evaluation of all aspects of the investment opportunity, including thorough due diligence on
the quality of the investment principals, serves as an essential precondition to committing
investment funds.
Written recommendations provide a particularly useful means of communicating
investment ideas. The process of drafting memos often exposes logical flaws or gaps in
knowledge. Awareness that a critical audience of colleagues and committee members will
review investment memos stimulates careful, logical exposition of proposals. Comprehensive
written treatments of investment issues provide a common background for staff and
committee members, supporting high quality discussion at meetings.
Better decisions come from small internal decision-making groups consisting of no more
than three or four people. As the number of people involved in a decision increases, the
likelihood of a conventional, compromising consensus increases. Obviously, with a large staff,
the same small group of people need not make all decisions. For example, different groups
might make recommendations for different asset classes, preserving the principle of small
group decision making while allowing organizations to engage the staff resources necessary to
deal with growing portfolio complexity and increasing asset levels.
Investment organizations benefit from the constant renewal provided by the addition of
young professionals. Their energy, enthusiasm, and fresh perspective prevent dry rot from
taking hold. The apprenticeship training process benefits both the trained and the trainer, as
the process of teaching benefits both the student and the teacher. As Yale economist James
Tobin observed, "I never fail to learn, from the students themselves and from the discipline of
presenting ideas clearly to them." In a well-structured organization, new hires make an early
impact. Pushing responsibility down in an organization improves performance and enhances
satisfaction.
Organizational Characteristics
Strong investment management groups share a number of characteristics, with great people
constituting the single most important element. In October 1987, Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson, then a senior executive at Goldman Sachs, speaking at Yale's School of Management,
articulated a compelling case that high quality individuals gravitate toward entities that operate
on the cutting edge, that embrace a global strategy, that provide opportunities to benefit from
focused mentorship, and that encourage early acceptance of significant responsibility.
Organizations on the cutting edge choose from a broader opportunity set. By examining
nontraditional asset allocations, investors improve the chances of finding a portfolio mix well-
suited to the institution's needs. By considering alternatives outside of the mainstream,
investors increase the likelihood of discovering the next big winner well before it becomes the
next big bust. By evaluating managers without the requisite check-the-box institutional
characteristics, investors boost the odds of uncovering a highly motivated, attractive group of
partners. Operating on the periphery of standard institutional norms increases opportunity for
success.
A global perspective facilitates understanding of investment alternatives, providing valuable
context for consideration of even the most parochial domestic opportunity. Aside from
improving an investor's decision-making framework, global reach increases the scope of
investment choices, enhancing the possibility of identifying superior options. Obviously, along
with the expanded range of possibilities comes the increased potential for failure. Overseas
commitments entail inherently higher levels of risk as availability of information and depth of
understanding almost invariably compare unfavorably to knowledge of domestic market
alternatives.
Focused mentorship provides essential training for new staff as individuals assimilate
investment management principles primarily through experience. While academic training
provides a necessary foundation, aspiring investors learn best through serving an
apprenticeship, benefiting from day-to-day exposure to the thoughts and actions of
experienced colleagues.
Giving Junior members of the team early responsibility challenges all members of an
investment organization to spread critical skills throughout the group. Transmitting key
principles to younger colleagues magnifies the impact of more senior players, broadening the
scope of an organization's reach and the range of its accomplishments. As a corollary benefit,
the training process reinforces and freshens the commitment of all participants to the group's
core investment beliefs.
While both organizations and individuals benefit from Paulson's paradigm of a cutting
edge, globally oriented institution that provides focused mentorship and early responsibility,
successful investment organizations require an additional dimension. Most operations thrive
by taking a conventional, middle-of-the-road approach to management. Success in investment
management requires an unconventional, out-of-the-mainstream understanding of markets.
Independent thinking contributes to strong investment decision making. Large,
bureaucratic plan sponsors provide an example of counterproductive practices where standard
investment manager search techniques exclude nearly all interesting managers from
consideration. By circulating "requests for proposals" that require vast quantities of detailed
information to complete, the bureaucrats encourage the wrong sort of manager to apply. The
seemingly endless questionnaires-that include criteria for minimum historical performance
levels, asset size, and years of experience-ensure conventionally unimaginative and ultimately
unsuccessful management. While the bureaucratic process practically guarantees poor results,
the bureaucrat's job proves secure, as massive stacks of paper protect every investment decision.
Bureaucracies lack the imagination and courage to pursuc nonconventional paths that prove
essential to building a successful investment program.
Self awareness plays a critical role in investment analysis. Understanding and exploiting
strengths makes an obvious contribution to performance. Recognizing and dealing effectively
with weaknesses represents a less obvious factor. Ruthlessly honest evaluation of absolute and
comparative advantages and disadvantages increases the likelihood of backing winners and
avoiding losers.
Frank, open discussions of failures and successes provide essential feedback for improved
decision making. By understanding failures, investors create the opportunity to avoid making
the same mistake in the future. Analysis of winners provides keys for unlocking future
successes. In contrast, assigning blame engenders an atmosphere that discourages risk taking.
impairing the investment process in a fundamental fashion. Stated differently, successful
investment cultures encourage professionals to find new mistakes to make, instead of simply
repeating old errors.
Providing an environment with low costs of failure encourages experimentation, allowing
investors to take well-considered, intelligent risks knowing that losses do not threaten careers.
The type of unconventional behavior necessary for meaningful investment success produces its
share of shortcomings.
Consider the record of the Yale investments team responsible for the university's stellar
record over the past two decades. In every instance where Yale launched a major investment
initiative (e.g., absolute return, real estate, timber, oil and gas, buyouts, venture capital,
international private equity, active domestic equity, and active foreign equity), the crack
investment team initially backed a manager that failed to stand the test of time. Yet, in every
instance, the initiatives (implemented by an improved set of managers) contributed
enormously to Yale's investment success. Encouraging experimentation and tolerating failure
represent necessary preconditions for developing winning strategies.
Collegiality plays a critical role in creating and sustaining an appropriate investment
environment. Supportive co-workers lessen the lonely contrarian's feelings of vulnerability that
stem from the frequent failures that mark even the most successful investment programs.
Understanding colleagues take some of the sting out of mistakes, facilitating continued pursuit
of risky investment opportunities.
Successful investors operate outside of the mainstream. In institutional settings which prize
conformity, pursuit of potentially rewarding investment opportunities requires strong
intellectual leadership. Without strong leadership, investment management decisions fail to rise
above normal bureaucratic standards and produce predictably mediocre results. By establishing
a decision-making framework that encourages unconventional, controversial actions, an
effective leader provides the foundation for a successful investment program.
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
The nature of the not-for-profit investment governance process has changed dramatically over
time. Decades ago, trustees generally chose individual securities at regularly scheduled quarterly
meetings. Simple portfolios contained relatively few positions, allowing full review in a period
of several hours. Finance committees populated by "titans of industry frequently contributed
direct, useful knowledge regarding individual security holdings.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the standard portfolio management structure involved a handful of
external managers who typically pursued balanced mandates and placed modest demand on
fiduciaries. Governance issues remained similar to those confronting trustees managing
portfolios "out of their back pockets." Instead of monitoring dozens of individual securities,
investment committee members tracked and evaluated a limited group of outside managers.
Because the managers invested largely in familiar securities and home markets, the process
proved comfortable for trustees and staff alike.
In recent decades, demands placed on investment staff and trustees have multiplied along
with the increase in the number of institutional asset classes and the corresponding explosion
in the number of specialty investment managers. Even as trustees deal with the greater
complexity of the investment world, they have encountered dramatic increases in the breadth
and seriousness of issues facing nonprofit institutions. As a consequence, many institutions
have devoted adequate time and attention to investment management.
The structure of investment organizations often failed to keep pace with changes in the
external world. In many cases, institutions remained rooted in the past, devoting insufficient
resources to financial asset management. Endowment management suffered in the not
uncommon circumstance where the treasurer spent only a fraction of the work week
supervising hundreds of millions of dollars. Failing to provide adequate staff support falls in
the category of penny wise and pound foolish. For every additional one percent per annum
added to investment returns, a half billion dollar endowment generates an incremental five
million dollars annually. The costs of a high quality investment organization pale in
comparison to the value of improved results.
Attracting and compensating qualified investment professionals poses challenges for
nonprofit institutions. In the private sector, financial services professionals carn staggering
amounts of money. In contrast, as is the case for most employees in not-for-profits, nonprofit
investment professionals carn substantially less than their for-profit counterparts. The
combination of a below market nonprofit pay scale and extraordinary private sector
compensation creates potential for divisive tension regarding compensation issues in the
nonprofit community.
Separate Management Companies
To deal with compensation issues, a number of universities established distinct management
companies to invest endowment assets. The fundamental problem with this organizational
(and in some cases, physical) separation concerns the tendency to treat the management
company solely as an investment entity. Proper stewardship of endowment assets requires
consideration of both spending and investment policies, with particular attention to the ways
in which they interact. The job is not likely to be well done if the management company takes
responsibility for investment decisions while others determine spending policies.
In fact, stewardship of endowment assets improves when the investment operation becomes
part of the fabric of the institution. The greater the degree of professional interaction between
endowment managers and the rest of the educational enterprise, the more credibility
investment professionals have in discussing and recommending spending policies. At
universities, common avenues of interaction include teaching by investment staff, sccking
portfolio advice from faculty, working with development office staff, and contributing to the
analysis of noninvestment financial issues. Aside from enhancing the overall contribution of
the investment operation to the wider organization, interacting with other parts of the
institution increases professional fulfillment for investment staff.
Ironically, establishing separate investment management companies to facilitate increased
compensation for professionals sometimes exacerbates the problem. Greater separation leads to
less identification with the institution, reducing the psychic income garnered from supporting
the not-for-profit's cleemosynary mission. Psychic income foregone must be replaced with hard
cash, further straining the bond between the management company and the rest of the
institution.
Stanford Management Company
The 2006 travails of Stanford Management Company illustrate in high relief the issues
surrounding compensation of investment professionals in an academic institution. In the
1990s, Stanford established its endowment management operation as an organization both
physically and psychologically separate from the campus. The investment team occupied some
of the most expensive real estate in the world on Sand Hill Road adjacent to the offices of
Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. For most of the 1990s, Lauric Hoagland ably led the
Stanford investment operation which produced consistently superior results. Mike McCaffrey,
former chief executive of investment bank Robertson Stephens, took over the management of
Stanford's portfolio in September 2000, building on Hoagland's base and running the
portfolio effectively in the difficult period following the collapse of the Internet bubble in
March 2000.
Yet, McCaffrey found it difficult to deal with the compensation constraints of the not-for-
profit world. He found that his employees faced a constant barrage of offers from the private
sector. Frustrated by staff turnover, he sought a means to increase his staff's compensation in
order to improve retention. He hit upon the idea of using Stanford Management Company to
manage external assets which would provide a revenue stream he could use to enhance his
colleagues' pay.
McCaffrey structured a proposal for the Stanford board. The plan made substantial
progress, gathering initial support from the trustees and indications of interest from both
individual and institutional investors. At the eleventh hour, however, McCaffrey decided not
to move forward based on an insufficient level of enthusiasm from Stanford.
Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, was one of the interested parties who hoped to invest a
portion of his considerable wealth with the Stanford team. Undeterred by Stanford's lack of
enthusiasm, McCaffrey and Allen formed a new venture, Makena Capital, to pursue the asset
management business as an independent entity. Two senior Stanford Management
professionals joined McCaffrey at Makena, gutting the leadership ranks of the university's
investment organization. Makena raised $7 billion in short order, including $1.5 billion from
Paul Allen, a stunning accomplishment for a start-up organization.
Among the troubling issues raised by the departure of Stanford's senior investment team,
the most important issue concerns organizational culture. By operating less like a not-for-profit
and more like an investment bank where pay matters above all else, Stanford Management
failed to select employees who identified with Stanford's institutional mission. Instead of
finding individuals who wished to carn handsome compensation and support one of the
world's great educational institutions, Stanford attracted investment professionals who were in
it for the money. Inevitably, the not-for-profit pay discount led to high turnover among those
who wanted Wall Street compensation.
A stable, cohesive team brings enormous strengths to the investment process. Aside from
the obvious benefits of continuity to portfolio management, investment professionals who
identify with the organization's mission and who become part of the fabric of the place
ultimately serve institutional needs in a superior fashion. Stanford Management Company's
failure to create a culture consistent with the university's mission ultimately imposed
significant costs on one of the world's great educational institutions.
Institutions need not establish separate investment companies to address compensation
issues. Exceptions to standard policies can be made to pay reasonably competitive salaries,
including the use of incentive-based compensation, without the radical break implied by
creation of a separate legal entity. Dealing with the trade-offs within the context of the
university, while difficult, lessens the magnitude of the problems associated with complete
separation of the investment management organization.
While the desire to create separate compensation schemes for university investment
professionals appears to drive the establishment of separate management companies, hopes for
improved governance may also contribute to the decision. As the breadth and complexity of
investment alternatives increase, so do the demands on trustees responsible for overseeing
investment operations. Establishing an independent management company allows the
institution to look beyond the existing group of trustees when selecting fiduciaries to oversee
endowment assets.
Yet governance issues can be addressed without creating a separate management company.
Since its establishment in 1975, Yale's Investment Committee included nontrustee advisors to
assist in governance. The use of outside advisors, who bring valuable insight and perspective to
the process, obviates the need to establish a separate investment company to draw from a
broader pool of governance talent. As an added bonus, service by outside advisors on the
investment committee gives an institution the opportunity to get a close look at an interesting
group of institutional supporters. In fact, at Yale, a number of investment committee members
have gone on to serve on the university's governing board.
Establishing appropriate governance and compensation structures for endowment
management organizations poses a difficult set of issues as radical differences between private
sector and nonprofit compensation levels create inevitable tensions. While establishing distinct
subsidiaries to manage endowment funds addresses oversight and pay issues, the accompanying
physical and psychological separation imposes significant costs on the broader organization.
Addressing compensation and governance concerns within the context of the entire institution
provides a solution more likely to produce results consistent with the organization's needs.
USE OF INTERMEDIARIES
In an effort to pursue an active management program without committing the required time,
energy, and resources, many institutions take the shortcut of using a fund of funds or a
consultant. Unfortunately, the use of external agents (instead of an internal investment team)
leads down a path to suboptimal results, as the interests of the fund of funds manager or
investment consultant inevitably diverge from the interests of the institutional investor.
Deep understanding of markets based on meaningful interaction between fiduciaries and
external managers provides the strongest foundation for investment success. Employing a fund
of funds manager or engaging a consultant places a filter between those entrusted with
responsibility for the assets and those making investment decisions. Without the confidence
engendered by thorough, direct understanding of manager actions and market opportunities,
investors Judge competence of external agents primarily by the performance numbers, which
constitute an insufficient, unreliable, and sometimes perverse measure. Risks associated with
distancing fiduciaries from investment managers dictate that fund of funds and consultancy
arrangements receive skeptical scrutiny.
Fund of Funds
Fund of funds managers provide the service of making investment decisions for fiduciaries. By
pooling assets, usually from less sophisticated investors, fund of funds managers argue that
economies of scale allow professional staff to manage monies in institutional fashion. Fund of
funds firms range from multiproduct concerns that provide one-stop shopping to entities
focused on specific niches, including nearly every asset class imaginable.
By providing manager selection and monitoring services, broad-based funds of funds
suggest that they enable smaller organizations to tap into otherwise unavailable sophisticated
investment strategies. Larger organizations sometimes hope to benefit by employing funds of
funds to gain exposure to unfamiliar market niches.
In spite of the purported benefits from employing fund of funds managers, substantial risks
stem from imposing a filter between the investment manager and the ultimate client.
Regardless of the level of disclosure provided by the fund of funds manager, transparency in
the investment management relationship declines dramatically. Clients unable or unwilling to
understand the underlying manager characteristics rely solely on performance to evaluate
investment strategies. When results disappoint, clients wonder not only about the investment
managers, but also about the competence of the fund of funds advisor.
Faced with poor performance, the client loses the benefits associated with delegating
responsibility to the fund of funds manager. Understanding the source of poor results requires
investigation of the underlying investment management organizations, a task that the fiduciary
hoped to avoid. Short of a thorough underwriting of the constituent managers, clients have no
alternative other than simply reacting to the numbers, exposing the portfolio to the damaging
prospect of selling low after having bought high.
When employing fund of funds managers, investors must search for firms with compatible
professional and ethical standards. Delegating authority to engage investment managers carries
enormous import. Even large, reputable fund of funds managers occasionally make
staggeringly inappropriate judgments. Several years ago, a private equity vehicle launched by a
multibillion-dollar fund of funds considered engaging an individual to manage an oil and gas
program. Aside from the fact that the individual's resume showed little direct relevant
experience, a criminal history clouded his past. Convicted of drug dealing, the purported
energy manager had also been arrested and convicted for spousal abuse.
Most investors, when confronted with this set of facts, move on to the next opportunity.
Under the best of circumstances, investing poses significant challenges. Hiring an
inexperienced partner with a criminal past increases the difficulties immeasurably.
What motivated the staff to propose backing a poorly qualified manager of dubious
character? While the full story likely contains a complex set of reasons, one obvious answer
stands out. Fund of funds managers justify their existence in part by making nonstandard
choices. Investing in the usual suspects provides less value added than does identifying
emerging managers unavailable to most market participants.
Ultimately, the fund of funds decided to put the former drug dealer in the energy
investment business. Not content simply to back this individual in the firm's standard format
as one of a number of managers in a pool, the organization decided to devote the entire energy
fund to this single manager. Life is too short to waste time making a concentrated bet on an
individual with a checkered past, when the world provides countless superior alternatives.
In another extraordinary incident, Paloma Partners, a multibillion-dollar fund of funds,
engaged John Mulheren's Buffalo Partners to manage a risk arbitrage portfolio. Mulheren
gained notoriety in February 1988, when he packed his trunk with a.233 caliber Israeli Galil
assault rifle, 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, .357 Magnum pistol, 12-gauge pistol-grip
shotgun, and three hundred rounds of ammunition, intending to shoot Ivan Boesky. Alerted
by Mulheren's wife, State of New Jersey troopers arrested Mulheren, preventing a possible
tragedy.2
Since Paloma Partners refuses to disclose names of underlying investment managers, even to
clients, most of the firm's investors were unaware of the relationship. Upon learning of the
involvement with Mulheren, a potential client challenged the fund manager, arguing the
investment did not meet institutional standards. "Mulheren's a great investor when he's taking
his lithium," replied the manager.
Adding a layer to the investment management process decreases transparency, posing
serious problems for fiduciaries. Instead of relying on someone's judgment in making
investment decisions, the fiduciary relies on someone's judgment about someone's judgment in
making the ultimate decisions. While commitments to convicted drug dealers and would-be
assassins represent extreme examples of poor judgment, the incidents highlight the risk of using
intermediaries to make decisions. The greater the number of layers, the greater the likelihood
that outcomes deviate from the fiduciary's preferences.
Aside from the issues of transparency and delegation of authority, fund of funds suffer from
burdensome fee structures. In the world of active management, the majority of assets fail to
produce risk-adjusted excess returns as the certainty of manager fees and transaction costs
overwhelm the false promise of investment success. Stated simply, the fund of funds manager
adds another layer of fees to already debilitating charges, further diminishing the chances of
realizing market-beating returns.
On top of the additional fee burden, the fund of funds faces the challenge of adverse
selection, which limits the available opportunity set. Investment managers vastly prefer direct
relationships with providers of capital. Funds of funds represent an inflexible and unreliable
source of funding, because they do not control directly the monies they employ to make
commitments. Since the highest quality investment managers enjoy the greatest ability to pick
and choose their investor base, the fund of funds fights an uphill battle in accessing top notch
investment firms.
Discrimination against funds of funds usually proceeds quietly, since prudent managers
guard against the day when they might need to tap fund of funds' money, however unreliable it
might be. Taking a rare public stand, in 2006, world class venture capital firm Sequoia Capital
eliminated all funds of funds from its investor ranks.3 By stating publicly what many managers
practice privately, Sequoia Capital highlighted the problem of adverse selection.
Some evidence for the underperformance of funds of funds comes from the 2006
NACUBO Endowment Study. Large endowments (with assets greater than $1 billion)
reported hedge fund returns of 11.0 percent for the year ending June 30, 2006. Small
endowments (with assets between $25 million and $50 million) posted hedge fund returns of
8.2 percent. What accounts for the difference? Funds of funds likely contributed to the
relatively poor performance of smaller endowments. According to the study, only 2.7 percent
of large endowments used funds of funds, while 47 percent of small endowments employed
funds of funds. Apparently, a relationship exists between the use of funds of funds and
substandard returns.
Further evidence on the poor returns generated by funds of funds comes from a study by
Josh Lerner of Harvard, Antoinette Schoar of MIT, and Wan Wong of Harvard. In Smart
Institutions, Foolish Choices?: The Limited Partner Performance Puzzle, the authors examine
investment returns for private equity funds selected by various categories of investors. Returns
on funds chosen by endowments produced "by far the best overall performance" with an
average internal rate of return (IRR) of 20 percent. Funds of funds failed miserably, selecting
partnerships with an average IRR of negative two percent.5 The academic research backs up
the a priori intuition. Investors sensibly avoid funds of funds based on issues of transparency,
judgment, fees, and adverse selection.
Consulting Firms
Seeking to supplement internal resources, many institutions engage consulting firms to
contribute to the investment process. The notion of employing qualified external resources
strikes many fiduciaries as a sensible means to deal with the complexities of portfolio
management. Unfortunately, the dynamics of the consulting business frequently drive clients
to suboptimal outcomes.
Consulting firms maximize profits by providing identical advice to as many clients as
possible. In the investment world, which demands portfolios custom tailored to institution-
specific risk and return preferences, a cookie cutter approach fails. Clients must either identify
a consulting firm that cares about goals other than profit maximization or manage the
consulting relationship to achieve appropriately tailored advice.
Consultants express conventional views and make safe recommendations. Because
consultants rarely espouse unconventional points of view, they provide more than adequate
cover when dealing with investment committees. Decision makers rest comfortably, knowing
that a recognized consulting firm blessed the chosen investment strategy.
Selecting managers from the consultant's internally approved recommended list serves as a
poor starting point for identifying managers likely to provide strong future results. No
consultant who wishes to stay employed recommends a start-up manager with all of the
attendant organizational and investment risks. Because consultants seek to spread the costs of
identifying and monitoring managers, consultants recommend established managers that have
the capacity (if not the ability) to manage large pools of assets. Clients end up with bloated, fee-
driven investment management businesses instead of nimble return-oriented entrepreneurial
firms.
Unfortunately, the economics of consulting drive an unusual wedge between the interests
of the consultant and the interests of the client. Ongoing demand for consulting services
requires that clients remain dependent on the consultant, reducing incentives for consultants
to move clients toward self-sufficiency. In extreme cases consultants recommend programs that,
while ostensibly in the client's interests, simply serve to assure a continued stream of income
for the consultant. For example, private equity consultants, also known as "gatekeepers,"
sometimes recommend direct co-investment programs to clients, which are obviously ill-
equipped to handle the program. (The client cannot even make a partnership decision without
assistance; how could the client make an even more difficult direct investment decision?) Along
with the co-investment recommendation, gatekeepers offer selection and monitoring services.
If successful, the gatekeeper locks in a combination of partnership selection, co-investment
advice, and monitoring services, creating an annuity stream lasting the life of the investment
program.
In an even more troubling development, many consulting firms now offer fund of funds
investment management services. The entire concept rests on an irreconcilable conflict of
interest in which the purportedly objective consultant recommends that the client hire the
consultant to manage assets. The combination of a self-interested consulting firm and the
structurally flawed fund of funds business leads to an ugly proposition for the investment
management client.
A former consultant summarizes the problems of the consulting industry in the following
polemic:
Ninety-five percent of institutions rely on a consultant to come in once a year, do a
manager search that costs $18,000 conducted by someone with four years of industry
experience, select a manager who is gathering assets, has good three-year performance
numbers (how many times have you seen a consultant or committee pick a manager with
poor three-year performance?) and has standard management fees. This scenario is
repeated daily in the endowment and foundation world. The same institutions will fire
the manager, who they barely know through their once a year client service presentation,
when they underperform for two years.
Consultants, for business reasons, cannot spend a lot of time on managers who will
keep their asset base small. The economics of scale are not there. If there is a great
manager who may have $50 million or $100 million of capacity per year, a consultant
cannot cover them in detail. It just does not scale. Therefore, consultants are geared
toward large managers with standard management fees that have lots of capacity going
forward.
Interposing consultants between fund fiduciaries and external managers creates a range of
problems that stem from a disconnect between the consulting firm's profit motive and the
client's investment objectives. While consulting firms offer a shortcut that avoids the hard work
of creating a dedicated investment operation, as is the case with many shortcuts, the end results
disappoint.
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS
Reasonable decision-making processes give appropriate emphasis to the range of issues facing
committee and staff. Charley Ellis describes a useful framework for categorizing various
portfolio management decisions. Policy decisions concern long-term issues that inform the
basic structural framework of the investment process. Strategic decisions represent
intermediate-term moves designed to adapt longer term policies to immediate market
opportunities and institutional realities. Trading and tactical decisions involve short-term
implementation of strategies and policies.
In his wonderful book, Winning the Loser's Game, Ellis bemoans the fact that decision
makers spend too much time on relatively exciting trading and tactical decisions at the expense
of the more powerful, yet more mundane, policy decisions. A decision-making process
centered on making high quality policy decisions increases an investor's chances of winning.
Policy Target Focus
Policy asset allocation targets represent the heart of the investment process. No other aspect of
portfolio management plays as great a role in determining a fund's ultimate performance. No
other statement says as much about the character of a fund. Establishing a governance
framework focused on policy decisions constitutes the most fundamental obligation of
investment fiduciarics. Without a disciplined, rigorous process for setting asset allocation
targets, effective portfolio management becomes impossible.
A robust discussion of asset allocation targets requires careful preparation. At the meeting
prior to the annual review, staff members present to the committee a brief description of the
issues they intend to analyze. The chair of the committee should encourage members to offer
suggestions for issues that the investment staff could then consider along with the internally
generated topics. A well-structured process underpins careful decision making.
Asset allocation targets ought to be reviewed once (and only once) per year. By
concentrating the discussion of investment policy in one meeting, the most important
investment decisions receive concentrated attention from both staff and committee. Perhaps
equally important, limiting policy discussions to the assigned meeting diminishes the
possibility of damage from ill-considered moves made in emotional response to the waves of
gloom or cuphoria that sweep over markets from time to time.
Yale and the 1987 Market Crash
The October 1987 crash in stock prices placed stresses and strains on decision-making
processes. Yale felt the pressure. In spite of the fact that the university had followed a quarterly
meeting schedule since the investment committee was established in 1975, two extraordinary
meetings were held in late 1987 and early 1988 in response to the crash. Even though at the
time of the meetings stock prices were substantially lower and bond prices measurably higher
than at the time of the June 1987 policy review, the committee discussed whether to increase
the policy allocation to bonds at the expense of stocks.
Yale made a disciplined late October, post-crash rebalancing purchase of tens of millions of
dollars of equities funded by a corresponding sale of tens of millions of dollars of bonds. In the
context of the gloom of late 1987, Yale's action appeared rash. Other institutions not only
allowed equity positions to drift downward by the amount of the relative stock market decline,
they further reduced equity exposure through net sales in November and December. Such sales
seemed prudent in an environment where the New York Times published a weekly chart that
superimposed 1987 stock prices on a chart of prices for 1929 through 1932.
Yale's internal committee dynamics proved difficult. In a written memorandum, one
member characterized Yale's asset allocation as "super aggressive" and on the "far edge of
aggressiveness. Citing bleak short-term prospects for equities, he commented that if Yale were
right to have an aggressive equity posture, the university will get "little credit," but if Yale were
wrong there would be "all hell to pay." Believing that "events of the past six months have
diminished long-term prospects for equity markets," the committee member concluded that
the university's assumptions regarding expected returns were overly optimistic. Hence, he
suggested that both short-term and long-term considerations required downward adjustment
of Yale's equity target. Another, more analytically inclined member, wondered if increases in
historical volatility made stocks less attractive on a relative basis.7 By questioning assumptions
that had been examined as part of the annual policy review only four months earlier,
committee members exposed Yale to the risk of an untimely reversal of strategy.
After much Sturm und Drang, Yale maintained policy targets, reaping attractive returns on
its post-crash rebalancing trade. In spite of the university's success, behind-the-scenes
discussions illustrate the potential danger of revisiting policy target levels too frequently,
particularly in the midst of a market crisis. While trauma surrounding the 1987 stock market
crash caused the university to violate past practice of limiting policy allocation discussions to
one meeting per year, disciplined implementation of a sensible policy ultimately contributed to
the pursuit of effective strategies in a difficult environment.
Although in retrospect the committee's actions appear innocuous, in other states of the
world the positions taken by the investment committee members could have had severe
repercussions for Yale's investment staff. In particular, the extraordinary memo containing a
committee member's ex post facto criticism of the policy allocation targets had dangerous
overtones. Had the market not recovered within a relatively short time frame, those staff
members closely identified with the rebalancing trade might have suffered serious damage to
their carcers.
Strategic and Tactical Issues
While the committee meeting on policy asset allocation represents the focal point of the
investment process, other meetings deal with important strategic issues. Following the close of
the fiscal year, a meeting devoted to portfolio evaluation discusses the character and
performance of the overall endowment and individual asset classes. Portfolio review
memoranda describe individual asset classes in depth, placing results in the context of market
conditions and identifying factors that influence significant investment opportunities. The
positioning of an asset class relative to its benchmark with respect to fundamental
characteristics such as size, sector, and style-highlights significant portfolio bets that are
evaluated retrospectively and prospectively. Active management efforts receive grades in the
form of detailed report cards for each manager. The individual manager assessments include
not only performance data, but information on reporting, transparency, fee structures, and co-
investment. Analysis of strengths and weaknesses of portfolio strategies leads to an outline for
future projects to improve portfolio management. In essence, the portfolio evaluation meeting
provides a backward-looking assessment and a forward-looking strategic plan.
The remaining two quarterly meetings generally have a topical focus, frequently involving
in-depth analysis of a specific asset class. Meetings centered on individual asset classes drill deep
to provide a granular view, allowing committee and staff to evaluate thoroughly every aspect of
asset class management. Decision-making assessments consider the impact of bets regarding
size, sector, and style. One particularly effective exercise goes well beyond traditional
performance evaluation by examining returns of terminated managers. In assessing
performance of fired managers relative to benchmarks and actual portfolio results, investigators
gain insight into the effectiveness of termination moves, a topic often comfortably ignored
after completing the difficult task of severing ties.
Asset class reviews provide a chance for external investment managers to engage investment
committee and staff in discussion of significant market issues. While sensible investors avoid
the all-too-prevalent "beauty contest" (in which a series of managers make difficult-to-
distinguish-between oral presentations in a hiring pageant), investment committee members do
benefit from face-to-face interaction with managers. Creating a forum for lively interaction
between managers and committee members adds value to the investment process. But, rather
than allowing managers to present "canned" portfolio appraisals, investment staff should
structure panel discussion to stimulate candid discussion of manager-specific approaches to
asset class pitfalls and opportunities.
Occasionally, committee meetings deal with market issues that cut across individual asset
classes. For example, the savings and loan debacle of the late 1980s informally influenced the
private equity, real estate, and absolute return asset classes. In the late 1990s the Internet mania
affected investments in the marketable equity, private equity, and absolute return asset classes.
Focusing attention on the broad implications of a particular market phenomenon enhances the
ability of an investment organization to pursue attractive strategies and to identify hidden risks.
Effective investors maintain focus on long-term policy targets, making the annual asset
allocation review the centerpiece of an investment fund's agenda. Devoting the meeting after
the close of the fiscal year to a thorough review of portfolio characteristics and performance
provides a report card for the past and a road map for the future. The two interim meetings
allow in-depth examination of a particular asset class or an interesting investment opportunity.
Hewing to a well-defined schedule of meetings provides a structure for effective decision
making and reduces the opportunity for committee and staff to make undisciplined moves.
DECISION-MAKING CHALLENGES
Effective endowment management processes encourage long-term investing. The universality
with which investors proclaim themselves long-term in orientation matches only the startling
degree to which short-term thinking drives investor decisions. Perhaps human nature dictates
that short-term issues overwhelm long-term considerations. Time horizons shrink with the
trauma of unexpected loss, the desire for immediate gratification, and the competitive need to
win.
The human desire to make a visible contribution shortens time horizons. Because
investment staff and trustees wish to leave their marks on the portfolio, potential problems
exist if the investment fund's horizon exceeds a staff member's expected tenure or trustee's
term. When managing perpetual life assets, explicit recognition of the discontinuity between
personal and institutional time frames facilitates effective decision making. Continuity in
management and governance provide another practical response.
Investors seeking short-term success will likely be frustrated by markets too efficient to offer
much in terms of easy gains. Even if managers find short-term opportunities to exploit, they
put themselves on a treadmill. As investors successfully exploit one short-term inefficiency, it
must be replaced by another position followed by another and yet another ad infinitum.
Creating wealth through a series of short-term investments is difficult, risky work. Moreover,
managers hoping to beat the market every quarter dramatically limit their investment universe,
pursuing only those mispricings likely to resolve themselves in the near term. Short-term
players create opportunities for those few who attempt to invest based on considered long-term
estimates.
True long-term investing dramatically broadens the investment opportunity set, allowing
investors to profit from the irrationality of short-term players. Yet, because long-term investing
involves an intrinsically higher risk profile, successful organizations must develop mechanisms
to cope with the associated risks.
Short-Term Thinking
Too many market players operate with short time horizons. Anecdotal evidence abounds that
many investment managers favor investment ideas that promise to pay off in three or six
months. At the same time, fear of failure causes portfolio managers to hug the benchmark to
avoid potentially disastrous falls to the bottom of the rankings. Mediocre performance
inevitably results, as managers incur high transactions costs pursuing second-rate ideas within
the context of an index-like portfolio.
Similar problems exist in the world of endowment management. Annual investment
performance comparisons create (or reflect?) a horse race mentality. An audience of trustees,
alumni, and faculty wait with great anticipation for the year-end results, comparing
performance numbers to those from the peer group with which the institution competes.
Short of beating an archrival at football, posting the highest one-year investment result ranks
near the top of the list of institutional aspirations. As if the one-year numbers were not
sufficiently short term, the consulting firm Cambridge Associates now publishes quarterly
results for endowment portfolios. Obviously, judging long-term pools of assets by trailing
three-month performance numbers induces the wrong kind of thinking, emphasizing short-
term considerations over all else.
Performance competition causes some institutions to engage in bizarre behavior, including
inflating published endowment values and reporting returns gross of fees. While secrecy
surrounding overreporting of endowment levels prevents accurate measurement, a distressingly
large number of institutions follow the practice of reporting gross returns. In the most recent
endowment return survey conducted by Cambridge Associates 8 percent of those participating
reported results before fees. Of what possible use are such numbers? From a budgetary
perspective, net returns provide useful data since institutions consume investment income after
fees. From an investment perspective, net returns allow measurement of true value added
relative to benchmarks. Barring a reasonable explanation, it appears that institutions report
gross returns simply to gain a dubious advantage in the annual investment derby.
Consensus-Driven Behavior
Endowment managers engage in behavior similar to mutual fund benchmark hugging with
peer group investment policies providing the stake to which an institution's asset allocation is
tethered. Varying too far from the group consensus exposes the manager to the risk of being
labeled unconventional. If the institution fails in its unusual approach, the policy will likely be
abandoned and the investment staff will likely be unemployed. In contrast, had the institution
failed with a standard institutional portfolio, policies may still be abandoned, but investment
professionals would likely remain gainfully, if not happily, employed.
Concern regarding peer behavior rests, in part, on a rational basis. Educational institutions
operate in a competitive environment, vying with one another for faculty, students,
administrators, and financial support. Endowment size helps define an institution's
competitive position, directly through provision of financial support and indirectly through
creation of reputational capital. If dramatically different investment policies cause one
university's endowment to decline precipitously, that institution may join a new, less
prestigious peer group, losing not only financial assets, but also the confidence of important
institutional constituencies. Conversely, unusual investment success enhances an institution's
financial and reputational position. Trustees, generally a risk averse lot, may prefer prospective
failure with a conventional portfolio to uncertain success with an unconventional approach.
However rational concern regarding peer behavior might be, if market participants weight
heavily the consensus portfolio in asset allocation deliberations, change becomes quite difficult.
In the extreme, fear of being different has everyone looking over their shoulder at everyone
clsc's portfolio and no one looking at fundamental portfolio structure. Sensible portfolio
management processes encourage the use of first principles to create portfolios appropriate for
the institution, not mindless replication of other institutional asset mixes.
Contrarian Opportunity and Risk
The attitude of portfolio managers contributes to the success or failure of an investment
program. Significant differences between successful investment operations and other well-run
business activities cause standard corporate management techniques to fail in the investment
world. Most businesses grow by feeding winners. Putting resources behind successful products
generally leads to larger, increasingly impressive gains. Ruthless cuts of failed initiatives preserve
corporate resources for more attractive strategies.
In contrast, investment success generally stems from contrarian impulses. View winners
suspiciously, consider reducing or even climinating previously successful strategies. Eye losers
hopefully; consider adding to the out-of-favor approach.
Contrarian investing represents more than a reflex action causing investors to mindlessly
"buy the dips." Out-of-favor positions must be supported by careful analysis of the
fundamental drivers of value. Investigation of the contrarian alternative both provides a
rationale for establishing the position and creates the conviction necessary to maintain the
position in the face of market skepticism. Do not expect immediate gratification. In fact, going
against the grain will likely appear foolish in the short run as already cheap assets become
cheaper, leaving the true contrarian fundamentally out of sync with investors more in tune
with the market.
Establishing and maintaining positions out of the mainstream requires decision making by
relatively small groups. As groups increase in size, consensus thinking increasingly dominates
the process. Behavioral studies identify a tendency for "group think." Most people so desire
conformity that they embrace obviously wrong positions to avoid being at odds with the
crowd.
Contrarian, long-term investing poses extraordinary challenges under the best of
circumstances. In an institutional environment with staff and committees and boards, nearly
insurmountable obstacles exist. Creating a decision-making framework that encourages
unconventional thinking constitutes a critical goal for fund fiduciarics.
Unfortunately, overcoming the tendency to follow the crowd, while necessary, proves
insufficient to guarantee investment success. By pursuing ill-considered, idiosyncratic policies,
market players expose portfolios to unnecessary, often unrewarded risks. While courage to take
a different path enhances chances for success, investors face likely failure unless a thoughtful set
of investment principles undergirds the courage.
New York University and Bonds
Even the most well-meaning fiduciaries, motivated by altruistic intentions, sometimes pursue
out of the mainstream policies which cause substantial economic and reputational damage.
The story of NYU's endowment management over the past two decades vividly illustrates the
dangers of implementing poorly founded investment strategies.
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, motivated by concerns regarding the fragility of the
university's finances and the riskiness of the stock market, NYU allocated an average of 66
percent to bonds, 30 percent to stocks, and 4 percent to other assets. NYU differed materially
from her sister institutions by holding roughly double the average proportion of bonds and
roughly half the average proportion of stocks.
Between 1981 and 1982, at the bottom of the equity market, NYU dropped its already low
equity allocation from 33 percent to 7 percent of the portfolio, increasing the already high
bond commitment from 62 percent to 90 percent of assets. Bonds continued to maintain a
share in excess of 90 percent of assets through 1985, according to public reports on asset
allocation, while stocks languished at single-digit levels, falling as low as 3 percent of the
endowment. Even though after 1985 annual reports ceased to provide information on
portfolio allocations, it appears that NYU persisted with its unusual portfolio structure
throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s. After a nine-year disclosure hiatus, in 1995 the
university reported holding 86 percent of assets in bonds and 9 percent of assets in stocks,
indicating a continuing commitment to bonds. Only in 1997 did NYU begin to make a
modest move away from fixed income to higher expected return assets.
Unfortunately, the bond-dominated portfolio left NYU on the sidelines during one of the
greatest bull markets in history. From 1978 to 1998, stock returns exceeded bond returns in
sixteen of twenty years, with stocks enjoying a 6 percent per annum advantage over bonds.
Only in the aftermath of the 1987 crash did the fixed income strategy appear sensible, causing
NYU board chairman Larry Tisch to receive a standing ovation at a NYU investment
committee meeting. Market activity supported only a brief huzzah as the S&P 500 ended the
1987 calendar year 5.2 percent above the level recorded at the beginning of the year. Even when
viewed from the perspective of a time frame as short as the twelve calendar months that
included one of the all-time great stock market debacles, NYU's strategy failed to make sense.
As the bull market continued apace, Tisch turned away questions regarding the lack of
equity exposure by responding that "the train has left the station."10 Meanwhile, the
opportunity costs for the NYU endowment mounted. From 1982 to 1998, an endowment
wealth index for colleges and universities increased nearly eightfold, while NYU's endowment
grew 4.6 times.11 Had the institution's results simply mirrored college and university medians,
in 1998 NYU's endowment would have been nearly a billion dollars larger than the actual level
of $1.3 billion.
Beginning in the late 1990s, NYU began to reduce its overallocation to domestic fixed
income, moving assets to domestic and foreign equities and absolute return strategies. Yet the
legacy of the misguided bond bet endures, as NYU's 2005 portfolio shows scant exposure to
the important asset classes of private equity and real assets. By failing to understand the
relationship between the permanent nature of endowment funds and equity investments,
NYU's endowment sustained long lasting, if not permanent damage.
Boston University and Seragen
Boston University's investment in Scragen, championed by the institution's former president,
John Silber, posed a fundamentally different threat to the health of the university's finances. By
funneling as much as $90 million of operating and endowment funds into a single
biotechnology-based start-up company, Boston University made an unreasonably large bet on
an extremely high risk investment. 12
Silber first became interested in Seragen's "fusion toxins" at a 1986 lecture by Boston
University scientist and Seragen founder Dr. John R. Murphy. In 1987, the university plowed
$25 million of its $175 million endowment into the venture, buying a controlling interest from
a Norwegian pharmaceutical company. Over the years, through further equity investments,
operating support, and asset purchases, Boston University's exposure to Seragen went from
excessive to irresponsible. In exchange for massive injections of funds, the university obtained
control of the board, with Silber among the designated directors.
The institution's unusually concentrated, controlling position in Scragen attracted the
attention of the Massachusetts attorney general who caused the university to dilute its
ownership stake by pursuing public offerings. Even though share issuance raised more than $50
million in 1992 and 1993, Seragen's burn rate managed to outpace the cash inflows. By 1996,
cumulative losses amounted to $200 million, causing Dr. Murphy to disassociate himself from
Scragen, citing "business problems."
In spite of successes on the scientific front, Scragen's finances faltered, leading to delisting
from the Nasdaq in September 1997. The stock, which went public in April 1992 at $12 a
share and reached a high of $15 in January 1993, traded at 5/8 upon delisting. At the time,
Boston University's stake amounted to little more than $5 million.
Desperate to salvage value, in December 1997, Boston University infused a further $5
million into Scragen by purchasing money-losing assets and providing ongoing support from
the university's operating budget. By buying time, the institution managed to arrange an exit
from the financially troubled company through a sale to Ligand Pharmaceuticals in August
1998. On September 20, 1998, the New York Times reported that the value of Boston
University's position ultimately amounted to approximately $8.4 million, representing a loss of
more than 90 percent on cost. Had the university's Seragen stake been invested in a diversified
portfolio of stocks, the endowment would have benefited by avoiding the disastrous Scragen
loss as well as by appreciation of tens of millions of dollars on the equity positions.
Ironically, Silber's positive assessment of Seragen's science appears well-founded. The firm's
major drug, Interleukin-2, received FDA approval in February 1999. Yet the university stands
to accrue little benefit from the drug's commercial success as Boston University's economic
interest in the project diminished greatly with the Ligand takeover. Seragen's progress came too
late and cost too much t reward the firm's shareholders.
By "rolling the dice" with endowment investments Boston University violated fundamental
investment principles, providing a disservice to the institutions' constituents. Haunted by its
failure to invest in Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone, the university vowed
not to repeat the mistake with Seragen. Unfortunately, spectacular investment success stories
become clear only after the fact, forcing sensible investors to avoid outsized bets. A high risk,
concentrated investment in Seragen, in the words of one faculty member, allowed Silber a shot
at leaving "as a legacy a gigantic endowment. "13 Fiduciary requirements, no matter how
liberally interpreted, fail to accommodate actions inconsistent with constructing a reasonably
diversified portfolio.
In pursuing investment policies motivated by a desire to create an impact, NYU and Boston
University inflicted serious damage on their portfolios of permanent assets. By playing a futile
market valuation game, NYU missed the benefits of one of the greatest bull markets ever. In an
ill-considered attempt to swing for the fences, Boston University suffered a dramatic direct loss
and incurred even greater opportunity costs. Responsible fiduciaries best serve institutions by
following basic investment principles, avoiding the temptation to pursue policies designed to
satisfy specific individual agendas.
PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT
Effective management of relationships between fiduciaries and investment advisors adds
substantial incremental value to the portfolio. Strong relationships based on mutual trust and
understanding allow money managers and clients to behave in an informed contrarian manner.
In the absence of well-grounded relationships, money managers place their business at risk and
clients run the risk of making ill-timed cash flow decisions, damaging the portfolio by buying
high and selling low.
Successful portfolio management depends on client comprehension of the investment
advisor's decision-making process. Without intimate knowledge of a firm's investment
principles, clients simply react to performance, a no win proposition. If fiduciaries chase
performance, funding a manager on a hot streak, disappointment results when the wind at the
manager's back inevitably dissipates. When contrarian instincts cause fiduciaries to back a
poorly performing manager, mediocre returns follow if poor performance persists because the
manager lacks skill. Distinguishing between good fortune and good judgment demands
thorough understanding of the manager's approach to investing.
Informed relationship management requires ongoing performance evaluation,
incorporating both qualitative and quantitative factors. Monitoring the quality and
commitment of a firm's principals plays a central role in assessing the ability of an organization
to achieve excellence. Other significant issues include fidelity to investment principles and
maintenance of an appropriate organizational structure. Regular face-to-face meetings between
fund managers and external advisors constitute the most important tool for performance
evaluation.
Portfolio return data provide essential hard input into the performance assessment process.
By comparing manager returns to passive market benchmarks and active manager benchmarks,
investors measure the successes and failures of an investment program. Sensible investors look
beyond the basic return data to understand the risks associated with the portfolios that
generated the returns.
Quantitative measures dominate performance evaluation exercises, reducing the complex
web of portfolio construction decisions to a precise presentation of return data. The stark
clarity of a set of historical performance numbers causes many investors to emphasize hard
quantitative tools at the expense of fundamentally important soft factors. Striking an
appropriate balance between quantitative and qualitative factors poses a challenge for fund
fiduciaries.
Sensible investors impose thoughtful limitations on a portfolio. By limiting commitments
to transparent, well-understood strategies, the universe of appropriate managers for a fund
coincides with the scope of that institution's expertise. While investors need not acquire the
depth of knowledge necessary to replicate an external advisor's investment management
process, careful clients obtain a complete understanding of portfolio strategies. Without a firm
grasp of the process, the client's role degrades to passive monitoring of performance, with the
dangers inherent in placing investment results foremost in manager evaluation.
Assessing the viability of manager relationships requires continuous monitoring of a
combination of qualitative and quantitative factors. Strong investment performance alone fails
to justify maintaining a manager relationship. If the sense of partnership diminishes because of
changes in people, philosophy, or structure, then tough-minded fiduciaries move on. Similarly,
weak performance fails to justify terminating an investment management contract. If strong
people in an appropriately structured firm pursue an intelligent approach to markets, elements
critical to investment success remain in place. While understanding the causes of poor
performance provides important insights for investment oversight, bad results in and of
themselves present no fundamental threat to an otherwise sound investment relationship.
Qualitative Factors
Just as qualitative considerations dominate hiring decisions, those same qualitative factors
dominate performance evaluations. If investment success simply required retaining managers
with strong performance and firing managers with weak performance, life would be simple.
Because the numbers provide only part of the story, difficult-to-evaluate qualitative factors play
a central role.
Just as the quality of people drives manager hiring decisions, monitoring the people
involved in the investment process drives relationship management. Short-run issues concern
the enthusiasm, motivation, and work ethic of investment advisors. Responsible fiduciaries
monitor the degree of an advisor's engagement, looking for warning signs of diminished
interest or commitment. In the long run, generational transition issues loom large.
Generational Transfer
While thoughtful planning by investment management organizations increases the likelihood
of successful transfer of responsibility from one generation to another, the process poses
significant challenges, particularly for smaller organizations. The idiosyncratic nature of small
entrepreneurial firms causes people to be far less interchangeable than would be the case at
larger bureaucratic money managers. People dominate process at smaller firms, producing
significant uncertainty in the period surrounding the old guard's retirement. Transferring
responsibility to younger colleagues inevitably alters the nature of the firm as the new decision
makers express their individual approach to markets. In short, the more attractive the
investment manager, the greater the challenge in passing the baton.
The venture capital community exhibits an unusual number of entrepreneurial firms that
succeed in spanning generations. By transferring responsibility seamlessly, early market
participants Sutter Hill (founded in 1962), Greylock (1965), Sequoia (1972), and Kleiner
Perkins (1972) each created and maintained leading positions in the venture capital
community. As a result of smooth general partner transitions and sustained investment success,
a number of well-established venture firms created franchise value, favorably positioning the
premier partnerships relative to the rest of the venture community. Outside of the private
equity world, few examples exist of small entrepreneurial investment firms retaining their
character through several generations of control. Some grow large, abandoning investment
goals to focus on asset gathering. Others, dependent on one or two individuals, fade away with
diminished participation from those who drove the investment process. Perhaps firms built on
the idiosyncratic brilliance of a successful investor stand little chance of transmitting essential
skills to younger associates. In any event, assessing the energy, commitment, and enthusiasm of
the individuals responsible for managing assets takes priority in monitoring relationships.
Firm Independence
The sale of an investment management firm requires immediate action. In a small,
independent partnership, economic fortunes of the principals correspond directly to the
success of the firm. The rewards associated with strong performance, and the penalties related
to poor results, accrue to the decision makers. Sales alter the equation dramatically.
After the sale, external owners prefer retaining assets by moderating investment bets,
increasing net client cash flow by enhancing marketing activities, and diversifying revenues by
expanding product offerings. On top of concerns regarding changes in corporate strategy, the
degree of commitment of investment professionals frequently wanes. Selling shareholders
retire to focus on other interests. The most talented young people leave to pursue
opportunities to create wealth, following in the footsteps of their now retired mentors. Those
who remain tend to be less adept with fewer alternatives. No advantage accrues to clients from
a sale.
Senior partners of successful independent investment managers face a dilemma. On the
positive side of the ledger, the sale of a firm produces a handsome payday for the equity owners
who walk away from the transaction with a small fortune. On the negative side, the sale sows
the seeds of the firm's denouement.
By not selling the firm, senior partners fail to maximize the value of their stake. In what
amounts to an act of noblesse oblige, younger principals receive equity interests for less than true
economic value, creating the potential for the firm to continue as an independent entity. No
guarantee of longevity exists, however, as the new owners now face the same dilemma their
erstwhile senior partners did.
Investment Approach
Changes in investment approach raise yellow flags for fiduciaries. Increases in assets under
management commonly alter investment methods. As assets increase, small-capitalization stock
managers purchase more and larger securities, increasing diversification and becoming less
small-capitalization-stock oriented. Some hedge funds, beginning as focused stock pickers,
evolve into shops making macro bets, as increases in size dictate playing in broad, deep, and
liquid markets.
Managers of all stripes face the temptation to become closet indexers. Running a market-
like portfolio guarantees market-like results, reducing the likelihood of being fired for poor
performance. When deep value managers report positions in growth companies, alert
fiduciaries pose skeptical questions.
Disappointing results sometimes lead managers to alter approaches to portfolio
management. Investment advisors may take greater risk, hoping to hit the long ball to recoup
earlier losses. At the extreme, pursuit of risk to remedy past losses exposes assets to significant
future losses as managers speculate in a desperate attempt to recover assets.
Poor results occasionally cause investors to undergo radical change, leading to bizarre
transformations. The Feshbach brothers, Matt, Joc, and Kurt, developed a high profile in the
1980s based on impressive investment returns and controversial short-selling techniques. Using
L. Ron Hubbard's Theory of Dianetics as an integral part of their investment strategy, the
Feshbach brothers focused on identifying overvalued companies headed for a tumble. Using
traditional securities analysis and private detectives to uncover fraudulent business practices,
the Feshbachs were widely rumored to "talk down" stocks in their portfolio. Accused of
"naked shorting to establish illegal short positions when unable to access securities through
legitimate channels, the brothers surrounded themselves with warning signs. Surprisingly,
many investors, including the Frank Russell Trust Company, ignored the controversy, chased
the Feshbachs' strong performance numbers, and committed funds to the brothers' pool,
which peaked at nearly $1 billion in 1990.
In the early 1990s the Feshbach wizardry disappeared, as the strategy of shorting securities
in a bull market produced the nearly inevitable disastrous results. After a spell of horrendous
performance, losing 55 percent of assets in 1991 alone, the Feshbach brothers reinvented
themselves.
In 1993, according to short seller David Rocker, the Feshbachs "publicly disavowed their
short selling activities... to focus on a strategy of small capitalization growth stocks." The
change in strategy, by the world's most notorious short sellers," akin to switching sides in the
middle of a battle, attracted more interest in the press than with investors. By 1998, the firm
managed $50 million, primarily in traditional long strategies, representing less than 5 percent
of peak assets under management. Apparently, the passage of time did little to improve the
Feshbach fortunes. A search of investment manager databases turned up very little beyond an
SEC Form 13-F for Matt Feshbach's MLF Investments. The December 31, 2007 filing reported
less than $60 million of positions.
Not all changes in approach bode ill for portfolio managers. For instance, a manager with a
narrowly focused opportunity set rides the investment roller coaster, rising when opportunity
abounds and plunging when deals dry up. Sensible managers adapt, altering strategy to exploit
the full range of opportunities within the advisor's area of competence. Many absolute return
managers began their businesses by focusing exclusively on merger arbitrage transactions.
Recognizing the complementary analytical and legal skills required to assess reorganizations
and bankruptcies, some firms started pursuing investments in the realm of distressed securities.
By adding a fundamentally related activity, managers created a powerful tool for portfolio
improvement. When merger and acquisition activity proceeded apace, portfolios held
significant positions in risk arbitrage. In less robust economic times, when workouts and
defaults littered the investment landscape, firms increased exposure to distressed investments.
In contrast to investors expert in only one discipline, managers with more than one arrow in
the quiver enjoy the opportunity to mitigate the cyclicality inherent in market activity.
Gradual, incremental changes in investment approach sensibly expand the scope of activity
without abandoning the base upon which the firm's success rests. Natural, evolutionary
improvement creates potential for enhancing portfolio results, benefiting external advisor and
client alike. Fundamental change poses danger to client assets, demanding a dramatic response
by fiduciaries.
Client Meetings
Regular face-to-face meetings between investment advisors and clients constitute the most
important tool for relationship management. Meetings allow challenges to existing processes
and exploration of new ideas. Frank discussion of advisor and client concerns contributes to
carly resolution of problems. While letters and phone conversations provide important input,
nothing matches the benefits of sitting down with an investment manager for an in-depth
review of portfolio activities.
Client responsibilities include being inquisitive without being intrusive. Respecting the
boundary between advisor and client requires avoiding behavior that makes investment
decisions difficult. Pushing advisors to take positions or discouraging specific investments
crosses the line. Challenging a manager's thought process or encouraging a contrarian play
contributes to successful relationships.
Investment advisor responsibilities include openness and honesty regarding portfolio
activity. Complete transparency in portfolio matters provides an essential foundation for client
understanding of the investment process. Occasionally, investment managers refuse to identify
positions, expressing concerns regarding public disclosure on ability to manage a position. If a
manager refuses to trust a client (or potential client) with portfolio information, the client
should not entrust the manager with a portfolio. Advisors benefit from better-informed clients
who tend to remain faithful during stretches of poor performance and facilitate sometimes
difficult contrarian strategies.
Openness regarding business issues allows advisor and client to understand the present and
to anticipate the future. Many business issues shape the character of a money management
firm. Compensation practices influence motivation and retention of investment professionals.
Succession planning tells as much about the character of the current generation as it does
about the next. Firms that engage clients in discussion regarding sensitive business issues face
stronger prospects of overcoming the difficulties inherent in running an investment
management operation.
Continuing due diligence checks on investment advisors contributes to effective
relationship management. Alert fiduciaries take advantage of opportunities to discuss with
third parties the business approach and ethical standards of existing managers, always
attempting to gain insight into external advisor characteristics. While less formal than the
round of reference checks undertaken before hiring a manager, ongoing due diligence provides
important insight into external advisor activities.
Regular interaction between client and advisor constitutes the most important tool for
relationship management, providing ongoing input for qualitative assessment of manager
activity. Constant reevaluation of the investment rationale contributes to effective oversight of
external money managers, causing fiduciaries to maintain an attitude of healthy skepticism
regarding active management activities.
Qualitative assessments of people, strategy, and structure lie at the core of relationship
management. Sensible fiduciaries regularly revisit the premises upon which original hiring
decisions rest, reviewing initial assumptions and subsequent behavior. Changes in an
investment advisory firm's circumstances require particularly careful evaluation, causing
prudent clients to underwrite once again the advisor's suitability.
Quantitative Factors
Beating the market, as described by a fair benchmark, constitutes the foremost objective of an
investment manager. Mature, liquid marketplaces offer a host of well-structured benchmarks
from which to choose. For example, U.S. cquity markets boast a variety of broad-based indices,
including the S&P 500, the Russell 3000, and the Wilshire 5000. The benchmark represents
the passive alternative, a portfolio that faithfully replicates asset class performance. Active
managers attempt to beat the benchmark, net of fees, in an effort to add value to the portfolio
management process.
In contrast to marketable securities, illiquid assets have less-well-defined, market-related,
performance measurement benchmarks. Private investments come from a wide variety of
sources, ranging from divisions of publicly traded companies to family-owned businesses to
entities in bankruptcy. Almost by definition, illiquid assets reside in markets without
benchmarks since an investable benchmark requires well-established, liquid markets.
Investors pursuing private opportunities employ jerry-rigged benchmarks, generally using a
derivative of a marketable securities metric, cither explicitly as in the S&P 500 plus 500 basis
points, or implicitly as in a real return of 12 percent (based, perhaps, on an expectation of 7
percent real returns for equities plus a 500 basis point premium).
Fiduciaries articulate a clear benchmark for each manager. In the liquid markets, a fair
benchmark encompasses all investment opportunities from which an active manager chooses.
The more liquid markets provide the best defined benchmarks, leading to the irony of precise
measurement in the markets least likely to produce something worth measuring. Managers
focusing on specific niches and investors pursuing activities in less efficient markets present
benchmarking challenges. Ultimately, the index against which fiduciaries assess performance
constitutes the manager's most important quantitative measure.
Benchmark Specialization
Investment consultants create and monitor an impressive number of specialized benchmarks,
providing apparently precise tools to measure performance of a broad range of strategies and
substrategies. Ranging from a reasonably standard matrix of style and capitalization indices to
a somewhat motley collection of esoteric measures, consultant benchmarks assess even the
most unusual approach to portfolio management.!!
Specialized benchmarks occasionally provide valuable insight unavailable from broader
measures of market activity. Consider the 2003 results for managers focusing on small-
capitalization stocks. Median returns of 45.7 percent bested the S&P 500 return by more than
17 percent, on the surface an excellent result. When compared to a small-capitalization
benchmark, however, the median results fall short of the passive alternative by 1.5 percent, a far
less impressive performance. The use of a specialized small-capitalization benchmark provides a
truer picture of active small-capitalization manager returns. 15 In the world of benchmark
comparisons, apples-to-apples provides more insight than apples-to-pears.
Specialized benchmarks sometimes require careful evaluation. Consider the results of value
investment strategies in the 1990s, a period when value managers generally failed to exceed
returns of a value benchmark. For the five years ending December 31, 1997, the value
benchmark placed in the second decile of value manager results, an extraordinary showing for a
passive portfolio, 16
Why did the value index crush the results of value managers? The value index, created by a
mechanistic screen that selected low price-to-book and low price-to-earnings ratio stocks,
included a number of unattractive, washed-out companies. Because active managers often
avoid obviously risky, distressed companies, typical active portfolios contain dampened value
characteristics. When value stocks perform well, active managers frequently fail to match
passive results, as markets reward the riskier profile of the mechanistically chosen portfolio.
Only in times of severe market stress do outcomes favor the higher quality actively managed
value portfolios.
Reasonable fiduciaries compare manager results to appropriate benchmarks. Examining
small-capitalization manager returns relative to the S&P 500 distorts the story. Comparing
value manager results to a broad-based index obscures the truth. Employing specialized passive
benchmarks provides a richer comparison, allowing more direct evaluation of style-specific
portfolios. When using specialized benchmarks, fair comparisons require an understanding of
the differences in risk profile between the active portfolio and the benchmark.
Peer Comparisons
Peer comparisons provide another quantitative metric for performance assessment. While
certain asset classes present less than satisfactory passive benchmarks, nearly every investment
category contains a group of managers among which results can be compared.
Survivorship bias and backfill bias play an important role in peer comparisons, particularly
in less efficient asset classes. Because market-related benchmarks provide so little short-term
guidance for private assets and absolute return strategies, peer comparisons take on more
significance. Unfortunately, in the absolute return arena, survivorship bias and backfill bias
dramatically influence the composition and character of the peer group. Private asset peer
groups suffer less extreme survivorship and backfill bias.
Risk Adjustment
Adjusting portfolio returns for risk plays at best a supporting role in performance evaluation.
Managers tend to avoid discussing risk, unless explaining poor relative performance, as in "we
did worse than the market, but we did it with less risk." Perhaps, the poor picture of risk
provided by quantitative tools justifies the low level of discussion.
Standard deviation of returns, the measure of dispersion most commonly used to assess risk,
fails to capture much of what concerns fiduciarics. Simply understanding the historical
volatility of returns provides little useful information regarding the efficacy of a particular
investment strategy. The fundamental risk of the underlying investment matters, not the
security price fluctuation. In a world characterized by excessive price volatility, security prices
mask true investment risk. In spite of its limitations, historical volatility is the most widely
employed quantitative measure of risk.
Nobel laureate William Sharpe developed an analytical tool to assess the relationship
between risk and return. By evaluating returns above (or below) the risk-free rate, the Sharpe
ratio focuses on the generation of excess returns. Dividing the excess return by the standard
deviation of returns produces a ratio describing the productivity of risk, quantifying the excess
return generated per unit of risk incurred. However, Sharpe's ratio suffers from the same
obvious shortcomings as do other measures of historical volatility.
The American Government Securities Fund
Consider the results of the Piper Jaffrey American Government Securities Fund (AGF), a
mortgage bond investment vehicle, for the five years ending December 31, 1993. As shown in
Table 10.1, AGF returned 19.3 percent per annum, representing a 13.7 percent annual
premium over Treasury bills. Since volatility of 8.8 percent accompanied the excess return,
AGF delivered a Sharpe ratio of 1.6 units of return for each unit of risk assumed.
From an investment perspective, AGF's 19.3 percent return appears at first glance to
overshadow the 11.2 percent return of the Salomon Brothers Mortgage Index. However,
because the mortgage index produced excess returns of 5.5 percent with substantially lower
volatility than AGF, the bond fund and the index sport nearly identical Sharpe ratios for the
period. In other words, AGF's higher returns appear to stem from accepting higher risk, not
from generating superior risk-adjusted returns. Sharpe's ratio levels the playing field.
Even though the Sharpe ratio illuminates historical relationships between risk and return,
backward-looking quantitative measures fail to capture fundamental risk factors other than
those in the numbers. When the future differs in material ways from the past, investment
choices based on quantitative analysis frequently disappoint investors.

The 1994 bond market debacle crushed the Piper Jaffrey AGF mortgage fund, causing
losses of nearly 29 percent with a risk level of nearly 15 percent. The Salomon Brothers
Mortgage Index fared somewhat better, as returns of -1.4 percent came with a risk level of 4.0
percent. AGF's Sharpe ratio of -2.2 for 1994 indicates risk-adjusted performance dramatically
inferior to the index with its ratio of -1.4.
Quantitative characteristics of AGF's mortgage strategy change dramatically as the trailing
five-year assessment period moves forward to include 1994. By including 1994's poor
performance and volatility, returns drop from 19.3 percent for the five years ending December
31, 1993 to 8.5 percent for the five years ending December 31, 1994, even as volatility increases
from 8.8 percent to 12.3 percent. Suddenly the double-digit return with single-digit risk
becomes a single-digit return with double-digit risk.
The Sharpe ratio story reads even worse. Annualized returns for AGF of 8.5 percent over
the five-year period ending December 31, 1994 generate excess returns of 3.7 percent at a risk
level of 12.3 percent. The resulting Sharpe ratio of 0.3 compares unfavorably to the ratio of 1.6
for the five years ending December 31, 1993. Even though the investment strategy remained
firmly in place, market conditions caused what appeared to be a reasonably efficient, high-risk
strategy into a low-return, high-risk technique.
In contrast, the five-year mortgage index return of 7.8 percent for the period ending
December 31, 1994, along with excess returns of 3.0 percent and risk of 3.5 percent provides a
superior set of characteristics. Although the risk-adjusted attributes of the mortgage index
deteriorate with the addition of 1994's data, the index's Sharpe ratio of 0.9 indicates a material
advantage over AGF's 0.3 level.
While quantitative risk assessment helps investors take a disciplined, analytical approach to
assessing investment opportunities, the limitations of backward-looking number crunching
become apparent when markets produce surprises. Based on data for the five years ending
December 31, 1993, Piper Jaffrey's AGF and the Salomon Mortgage Index garnered identical
Sharpe ratios, indicating roughly equivalent efficacy in translating risk into excess return.
Moving forward one year makes the turtle-like index appear much more attractive than the
hare-like mortgage fund.
In the case of the Piper Jaffrey mortgage fund, historical return and risk characteristics
point investors toward poor timing decisions. In late 1993, attracted by high returns and index-
like efficiency, investors saw ample reason to purchase shares of the fund. In late 1994,
disappointed by terrible returns and poor relative efficiency, investors found clear justification
to sell shares. Of course, in 1995, in spite of poor trailing five-year quantitative characteristics,
the fund returned 25.9 percent, vastly exceeding the index returns and matching the index
delivery of excess return per unit of risk.
The only defense against chasing the excellent 1993 numbers and avoiding the dismal 1994
returns lies in fundamental understanding of the nature of the investment activity producing
the results. Investors making decisions based only on historical numbers focus exclusively on
what has been, ignoring what will be. While looking into the future poses challenges fraught
with peril, investors armed with a thorough grasp of the forces driving valuations face a higher
probability of success. At the very least, investors cognizant of the nature of AGF's mortgage
portfolio recognized the contribution of leverage to 1993's strong performance and considered
the danger of an extreme reversal in a 1994 type of environment.
Risk adjustment matters. Unfortunately, reducing risk assessment to a single statistical
measure fails to capture the essence of the concept. Prudent investors employ risk measure with
care, supplementing the science with careful interpretation.
Rates of Return
The most basic financial tools measure returns either weighted by dollars or linked across time.
Dollar-weighted returns, or internal rates of return (IRR), assess results considering the
magnitude and timing of dollars invested. IRR calculations best measure returns for
investment managers that control cash flow decisions, such as private equity investors who
determine when and how much to invest in particular opportunities.
Time-linked returns derive from a series of periodic returns, without considering portfolio
size at any point in time. Time-linked returns best measure results for managers that do not
control cash flow decisions, such as marketable securities managers that accept contributions
and withdrawals based on client decisions.
Barr Rosenberg's Value Added
Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management's (RIEM's) core equity product provides an
interesting example of differences in dollar-weighted and time-weighted returns. As illustrated
in Table 10.2 RIEM began corporate life with extremely strong returns on relatively small
amounts of money. Following a pattern typical in the investment management industry,
impressive results attracted large new accounts, with assets peaking at more than $8,100
million in 1990. As asset size created a headwind or as good fortune dissipated, poor
investment performance followed, exposing large amounts of money to sub-standard
management.
Over the firm's roller-coaster history, time-linked investment performance remained
consistently positive. For the twelve years ending December 31, 1997, RIEM's core equity
portfolio returned 17.3 percent per year, cking out a 30 basis point advantage relative to the
S&P 500.
Dollar-weighted returns tell a less inspiring story. IRR calculations show a return of 11.8
percent per annum. Had RIEM's cash flows been invested in the S&P 500, the resulting IRR
would have been 13.1 percent per annum. Over the life of the core portfolio, REIM's clients
lost 1.3 percent annually relative to the market, translating into approximately $500 million of
opportunity costs.

In evaluating marketable security performance, both time-linked and dollar-weighted
returns prove helpful. Time-linked returns provide evidence regarding a manager's investment
acumen. Dollar-weighted returns shed light on cash flow timing decisions made by investors.
When evaluating private investment performance, dollar-weighted returns provide the most
appropriate measurement tool, as private investors control cash flow decisions.
Successful portfolio management combines art and science, requiring qualitative and
quantitative assessment of investment strategies. While quantitative measures provide essential
data for decision makers, reasonable fiduciaries guard against placing too much emphasis on
easily quantified factors at the expense of less easily measured qualitative factors. Successful
relationship management demands placing soft factors in a place of primary importance. The
numbers, while important, play a supporting role.
Use of Performance Assessment
Investors employ performance assessment to hire managers, size accounts, and fire managers,
with the choice of time frame providing a critical variable in the evaluation process.
Thoughtful use of performance data creates opportunities to add substantial incremental
returns, while misdirected actions readily destroy value.
The appropriate time frame for performance assessment depends on the asset class involved
and management style employed. Feedback mechanisms operate over different cycles. Money
market investments provide nearly immediate feedback, as assets mature within a matter of
months, either successfully or not. The short cycle provides fiduciaries with substantial
amounts of round-trip data. Unfortunately, in the highly efficient money markets, the
information generates little opportunity to add value.
Private investing stands at the opposite end of the spectrum. Holding periods for assets span
as much as a decade, forcing fiduciaries to make manager retention decisions well before
meaningful feedback comes from recent investment activity. The long private investing cycle
causes investors to make decisions based on factors other than near term investment
performance.
Other asset classes fall between the money market and private equity extremes. The time
necessary for feedback mechanisms to operate corresponds roughly to the manager's
investment horizon. The shorter the horizon, the shorter the time needed to assess manager
skill. In the marketable securities realm, high turnover indicates a relatively short-term horizon,
suggesting short-term evaluation of the manager's trades. Consider the fact that 200 percent
turnover corresponds to a six-month average holding period. In contrast, 20 percent turnover
corresponds to a five-year average holding period. Low turnover strategies deserve longer-term
evaluation, allowing time for the investment manager's strategy to play out. In the realm of
private investing, time horizons appropriate for manager evaluation extend much longer.
While portfolio turnover identifies the average holding period for positions and suggests an
appropriate minimum time frame for evaluating money manager trades, market forces often
befog the view of manager performance. Multiyear moves in the relative attractiveness of small
versus large and value versus growth highlight the importance of employing appropriate
benchmarks and lengthen the time required to assess manager skill. Serious investors avoid hair
trigger decisions, opting instead for careful, deliberate assessments that span the market cycle
appropriate to a specific manager.
Performance evaluation ultimately determines the fiduciary's degree of confidence in an
external money manager. Reassessing manager relationships places investors in an
uncomfortable position, as reasonable investors engage investment advisors with a view toward
establishing long-term relationships. Questioning the validity of the original hiring decision
and examining the continued viability of the investment relationship causes some measure of
cognitive dissonance. Careful fiduciaries seek stable, long-term arrangements, even while
evaluating their dissolution.
The degree of confidence in particular managers influences portfolio allocations, with high
confidence managers receiving greater funding levels. Periodic reviews of manager account sizes
allow portfolios to reflect opinions regarding relative manager skill levels. Well-considered
manager allocations incorporate factors other than confidence levels, including the appeal of
the manager's particular strategy as well as the number of managers available to exploit a
specific type of opportunity. That said, performance evaluation plays a dominant role in
determining allocations.
With a clear grasp of a manager's approach to markets, clients obtain opportunities to add
value through the portfolio rebalancing process. If manager account sizes generally reflect
fiduciary preferences, recent performance might be used as a secondary indicator for targeting
contributions and withdrawals. Even the most skilled managers experience periods of
underperformance, attributable to positions that, once established, perform contrary to
expectations. If, in the face of poor results, the original investment case remains intact, adding
funds to an out-of-favor strategy increases exposure to a now even more attractively priced
opportunity. Managers tend to react positively to the vote of confidence implicit in client cash
flows arriving after a period of poor results.
In contrast, following periods of better than expected performance, thoughtful clients
consider reducing account size. Extraordinary performance likely stems from a combination of
manager skill and fortuitous market conditions. Reducing the account of an outperforming
manager and reallocating funds to weaker performers generally enhances performance. While
managers enjoy receiving cash flow, particularly when their investment style lacks favor in the
marketplace, managers dislike disgorging funds. Managers frequently blame the market for
poor results; skill completely explains their strong performance.
In any event, reasonable clients avoid costly disruptive cash flow requests. Withdrawals
require particular care, since incurring unnecessary transactions costs dampens portfolio
returns. Contributions to poor performers and withdrawals from strong performers might be
made as part of a fund's rebalancing activity, generating only transactions already required for
risk control purposes and facilitating low-cost repositioning of the portfolio.
Manager Termination
The impetus for manager termination generally falls into one of two broad categories. First, the
initial hiring decision may have been a mistake. Regardless of the thoroughness of due diligence
efforts, the true nature of an investment relationship emerges only after advisor and client work
together for a period of time. Reexamination of initial assumptions causes fiduciaries to
continue to learn about the manager's process, either reinforcing the work that supported the
hiring decision or exposing shortcomings in the original analysis. Second, changes in people,
philosophy, and structure require reassessment of manager relationships. Significant changes
prompt sensible fiduciaries to take a fresh look at the manager, subjecting the relationship to a
thorough reevaluation.
The most difficult part of managing a portfolio of external advisors involves termination of
unsatisfactory relationships. The unpleasant nature of firing a manager causes many investors
stay with dysfunctional manager-client relationships far longer than prudent.
Rationalizations for maintaining the status quo abound, providing superficial justification for
avoiding the unpleasant task at hand.
Top-notch fiduciaries approach the manager evaluation task with a cool analytical mindset
that borders on heartlessness. Once investors determine that mistakes led to the hiring of a
manager or changes in circumstance cause the manager to be unfit, the termination notice
must follow. In the final analysis, careful fiduciaries ask if the manager would be hired today. A
negative answer points to termination.
CONTROL ENVIRONMENT
Back office operations represent a significant, yet often overlooked, source of risk. Operational
controls do not appear on the radar screens of most institutional fund managers, a
prefer to deal with the engaging issues surrounding portfolio management strategies. Fund
managers ignore control environment issues at their peril; a major operational failure moves
investors
internal control issues from an obscure place in the background to an embarrassing role on
center stage.
Endowment fund investors face control risks internally and externally. Internal control risks
consist of exposures created at fund headquarters in the course of day-to-day portfolio
management activities. If all assets were managed in-house, investors would face only internal
control issues. Conventional audit procedures focus on internal practices, examining the
efficacy and integrity of systems designed to support investment operations. External control
risks consist of exposures created at outside managers. Traditional audit activities rarely assess
directly the control systems of external investment managers, relying instead on work
conducted by other professional service firms. Since a chain is only as strong as the weakest
link, both internal fund operations and external manager back office operations require careful
examination and oversight.
Inadequate control environments provide fertile breeding grounds for problems ranging in
severity from continual imposition of small costs to sudden headline-grabbing disasters. Poorly
conceived controls expose investors to the possibility of fraud and malfeasance. Pain avoidance
requires careful planning. Unfortunately, institutions tend to focus on mundane back office
operations only after incurring significant losses.
Investment organizations benefit from regular, independent, intensive external review of
operational practices. For simple portfolio structures, internal and external auditors provide a
comprehensive look at investment activity, examining relatively basic issues related to
safekeeping portfolios of standard marketable securities. As increasingly sophisticated portfolio
management activities add layers of complexity, generalist auditors face a dramatically more
difficult task. To deal effectively with more complex investment programs, sensible fiduciaries
engage high quality specialists to assess internal and external practices, providing an important
tool for evaluating an often-ignored aspect of investment management.
A strong audit team from a first-class firm constitutes the first line of defense against
internal control problems. While a thorough audit represents an important starting point, in
today's investment management world, routine annual reviews no longer adequately assess
portfolio practices. Occasional, "no holds barred" special audits by a team of experts provide
important strategic insights into risks confronting fund fiduciaries, allowing remediation of
existing issues and mitigation of potential problems.
Special Audits
Effective special audits engage high quality experts in an unrestricted, independent review of
control practices. By bringing a fresh perspective to the oversight process, the investigative team
causes staff members to revisit comfortable assumptions regarding internal operations,
challenging individuals to improve existing procedures. Best practices provide a standard
against which to measure current activities and future efforts.
Since 1990, Yale twice employed PricewaterhouseCoopers and once employed Deloitte &
Touche to undertake top-to-bottom examinations of the university's investment operations.
The first review provided a substantial amount of useful feedback, highlighting the risks in
security lending activitics. Prompted by the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, the university
took a fresh look at the internally managed security loan program, concluding that structural
changes in the market had transformed a once attractive opportunity into an unattractive risk-
reward activity. As a result, the university discontinued its security lending operations, a move
that appeared prescient when the Common Fund's security lending debacle became public
sometime later. III
A second special audit of Yale's investment operations by PricewaterhouseCoopers
concluded that, while industry "best practices" characterized the university's monitoring of
external manager back offices, room for improvement existed. Standard industry practice
involves relatively superficial investigation of internal controls at external managers, if such
controls receive any attention at all. Since external manager control processes contribute to the
integrity of the overall control framework within which the endowment operates, the
university's risk exposure depends on the quality of these sometimes superficially evaluated
manager operations.
PricewaterhouseCoopers concluded that Yale had an opportunity to redefine industry
standards by understanding and improving the financial control environment, internally and
externally. The basic job description involves evaluating regulatory compliance, internal
operations, accounting and trading systems, legal and auditing professional support, as well as
policies for asset valuation, risk assessment, derivatives, and soft dollars. Yale's compliance
efforts create opportunities to reduce risk by introducing superior practices identified at onc
manager to other managers, thereby improving control processes across the entire portfolio.
Not only does the university benefit from evidence gathered when examining the control
environment at outside managers, the evaluation process communicates the importance Yale
attaches to strong internal operations. Such attention prompts managers to focus appropriate
levels of time and energy on back office activities.
CONCLUSION
One of the most important distinctions in the investment management arena separates those
investors with the ability to make high quality active management decisions from those
investors without the resources to make such decisions. Active management opens up the
possibility of employing asset classes that require superior investment skill-absolute return,
private equity, and real assets. As an added attraction, active management provides the
possibility of producing market-beating results in domestic and foreign marketable equities. In
contrast, without active management skill, prudent investors limit choices to passively
managed marketable security asset classes. Only foolish investors pursue casual attempts to beat
the market, as such casual attempts provide the fodder for the skilled investors' market-beating
results.
A disciplined framework for decision making underpins successful investment operations.
Clear definition of the respective roles of staff and committee ensures that staff members drive
the process, while committee members provide effective oversight. Without a rigorous process,
informed by thorough analysis and implemented with discipline, investment portfolios tend to
follow the whims of fashion. Casually researched, consensus-oriented investment positions
provide little prospect for producing superior results in the intensely competitive investment
management world.
An effective investment process reduces the inevitable gap between the goals of the
institution and the actions of the portfolio's stewards. Trustees strive to make a difference
during their tenure, while staff members seek job security, with both aspirations potentially at
odds with long-term institutional goals. By establishing and maintaining investment operations
as part of the fabric of the institution, fiduciaries increase the likelihood of placing institutional
needs ahead of personal interests.
Intermediaries, such as consultants and funds of funds, add another layer to the investment
process, introducing a dysfunctional filter that serves to impair returns. Institutions that avoid
employing intermediaries and engage dedicated staff resources stand a far better chance of
success.
A sound decision-making process contributes significantly to investment success, allowing
investors to pursue potentially interesting, long-term contrarian investment positions. By
reducing pressures to perform quarter-to-quarter, liberated managers gain the freedom to
create portfolios positioned to take advantage of opportunities created by short-term players.
An environment that encourages managers to make potentially embarrassing out-of-favor
investments and tolerates the inevitable missteps increases the likelihood of investment success.
Long-term success requires individualistic contrarian behavior based on a foundation of
sound investment principles. An effective framework overcomes the handicap of group
decision making and promotes well-considered risk taking. A thoughtful, high quality
governance process serves as an essential underpinning of a successful investment program.
Sensible investors assess investment advisory relationships with a balance of soft qualitative
attributes and hard quantitative characteristics. Qualitative factors play a central role in
manager evaluations, placing people at the core of portfolio structuring decisions. Critical
variables include the quality of investment professionals, the strength of the investment
philosophy, and the character of the organizational structure. Regular face-to-face meetings
constitute the most important manager monitoring tool.
Quantitative management tools include return data on individual portfolios, market
benchmarks, and active manager universes. Overreliance on the neat precision of numerical
results frequently leads to poor decisions. Investors looking only at the numbers face the
prospect of buying high and selling low, making commitments prompted by strong results and
withdrawing funds based on poor performance.
Successful investment programs require open, honest relationships between institutional
clients and external money managers. Direct, frequent communication allows investors to take
advantage of market opportunities. When declining prices allow purchase of assets on
attractive terms, high quality clients provide incremental funds to exploit the opportunity.
Conversely, thoughtful money managers with relatively few attractive opportunities return
funds to clients. Such activity takes place only when a high degree of confidence and trust exists
between money managers and clients.
Performance evaluation drives portfolio allocation decisions, as conclusions regarding
manager ability influence the confidence of fiduciaries. In many respects, the investor faces a
binary decision. If confidence exists, fiduciaries muster the courage necessary to behave in a
contrarian manner, supporting managers experiencing a spell of poor results. If a fiduciary
lacks the confidence to increase exposure to an underperforming manager, either the manager
or the fiduciary should go.

issues faced by investors without the resources to pursue active management programs.
II. For example, consider the Bloomberg Football Index, an index of companies that own or operate English and
Scottish football clubs.
III. Yale's security lending operation, managed much more conservatively than The Common Fund's, pursued a
matched book strategy. That is, maturities of security loans matched maturities of investments, with the university
generating returns by accepting credit risk in the reinvestment vehicle. Prompted to examine the issue by the
PricewaterhouseCoopers study, Yale concluded that spreads were too thin to justify continuing the security lending
operation. The Common Fund, motivated by the thin spreads in a matched book operation, took significantly greater
risk in an effort to generate a meaningful return. See Chapter 6.
