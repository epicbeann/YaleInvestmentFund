Investment and Spending Goals
Endowment
Endowment managers pursue the conflicting goals of preserving purchasing power of assets
and providing substantial flows of resources to the operating budget. If fiduciaries produce
spending and investment policies that deal successfully with the tension between the goals, the
institution receives a sustainable contribution from endowment assets to support academic
programs. Asset preservation and stable budgetary support, if achieved, satisfy the purposes of
endowment accumulation-maintaining independence, providing stability, and creating a
margin of excellence.
Benjamin Franklin observed that death and taxes represent life's only certainties. Managers
of endowment assets suspend those certainties, as educational institutions aspire to exist in
perpetuity and endowment assets enjoy exemption from taxes. The perpetual nature of colleges
and universities makes endowment management one of the investment world's most
fascinating endeavors. Balancing the tension between preserving long-run asset purchasing
power and providing substantial current operating support provides a rich set of challenges,
posing problems unique to endowed educational institutions.
Purchasing power preservation represents a long-term goal, spanning generations.
Successfully managed endowments retain forever the ability to provide a particular level of
institutional support, justifying the classification of endowment funds as permanent assets.
Pursuit of long-term asset preservation requires seeking high returns, accepting the
accompanying fundamental risk and associated market volatility.
Stable operating support constitutes an intermediate-term goal, reflecting the demands of a
shorter-term budgetary planning cycle. Since academic programs contract only with great
difficulty, institutions rely on reasonably predictable flows of funds from endowment to
support operations. Supplying stable distributions for current operations requires dampening
portfolio volatility, suggesting lower levels of fundamental risk with the accompanying lower
levels of expected returns.
The high risk, high return investment policy best suited to serve asset preservation conflicts
with the low risk, low return investment approach more likely to produce stable distributions
to the operating budget. Spending policies deal with the conflict, in part by dampening the
transmission of portfolio volatility to budgetary distributions. Further, by specifying
institutional preferences regarding the trade-off between purchasing power preservation and
stability of flows to fund operations, spending policies determine the degree to which
endowments meet the needs of current and future generations.
INVESTMENT GOALS
The late Yale economist James Tobin captured the essence of the investment problem facing
fiduciaries:
The trustees of an endowed institution are the guardians of the future against the claims
of the present. Their task is to preserve equity among generations. The trustees of an
endowed university like my own assume the institution to be immortal. They want to
know, therefore, the rate of consumption from endowment which can be sustained
indefinitely.... In formal terms, the trustees are supposed to have a zero subjective rate
of time preference.
Consuming endowment income so defined means in principle that the existing
endowment can continue to support the same set of activities that it is now supporting.
This rule says that the current consumption should not benefit from the prospects of
future gifts to endowment. Sustained consumption rises to encompass and enlarge the
scope of activities when, but not before, capital gifts enlarge the endowment.1
Tobin's concept of intergenerational equity comports with the goals of purchasing power
preservation and stable operating budget support. By preserving endowment assets adjusted
for inflation, the institution retains the ability to "support the same set of activities that it is
now supporting." In supplying a stable flow of resources for operations, the endowment
provides continuity of support, avoiding disruptive interruptions in distributions to academic
programs.
Gifts and Endowment
When making an endowment gift, donors intend to provide permanent support for the
designated activity. If financial managers maintain only the nominal value of gifts, inflation
ultimately reduces to insignificance the impact of the fund. Yale's oldest surviving endowment
fund dedicated to the support of teaching, the Timothy Dwight Professorship Fund
established in 1822, entered the university's books at an historical cost basis slightly in excess of
$27,000. Because price levels rose nearly twenty-seven fold in the intervening 185 years, a 2007
distribution from an endowment of $27,000 pales in comparison to an 1822 distribution from
the same size fund. While during the Dwight Professorship's existence, the fund grew more
than eighteen times to nearly $500,000, the current value falls short of the inflation-adjusted
target by nearly one-third. Even though the university continues to benefit from the Timothy
Dwight Professorship in the early twenty-first century, after accounting for inflation the fund
fails to provide the same level of support available in the early nineteenth century. While
fiduciary principles generally specify only that the institution preserve the nominal value of a
gift, to provide true permanent support institutions must maintain the inflation-adjusted
value of a gift.
Explicitly stating that new gifts allow an institution to "enlarge the scope of activities,"
Tobin recognizes a principle important to endowment benefactors. Some institutions factor
gifts into spending considerations, targeting a consumption level equal to the portfolio's
expected real return plus new gifts. Harvard University, in fashioning its 1974 spending policy,
assumed that "university expense growth would exceed [the long-term inflation] rate by two
points. 2 Yet the institution's targeted reinvestment rate offset only the general level of
inflation, not the higher university expense growth. Obviously, supporting the "same set of
activities required keeping pace with university expense growth, not general inflation,
rendering the reinvestment rate inadequate to its purpose. To maintain endowment
purchasing power, Harvard articulated a goal of accumulating sufficient new capital gifts to
offset the difference between the general inflation rate and university expense growth. In so
doing, the university explicitly employed new gifts to replenish inflationary losses.3
Using new gifts to offset part of the impact of inflation on asset values fails to "enlarge the
scope of activities supported by endowment. If a fund devoted to supporting a chair in the
economics department loses purchasing power, establishing a new chair in the law school does
nothing to replenish the economics department's loss. From a bottom-up basis, donors have
the right to expect that each individual endowment fund will retain purchasing power through
time.
Trade-off Between Today and Tomorrow
Fund managers charged only with preserving portfolio purchasing power face a
straightforward task. Simply accumulating a portfolio of Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities (TIPS) allows investors to generate inflation-sensitive returns guaranteed by the
government. Unfortunately, the excess of university inflation over general price inflation may
well consume any incremental returns from TIPS, providing almost no real return to the
institution. Such single-minded focus on asset preservation fails to meet institutional needs, as
merely accumulating a portfolio of assets with stable purchasing power provides little, if any,
benefit to the academic enterprise.
Endowment assets benefit educational institutions primarily by generating substantial
reliable distributions to support operations. Fund managers with a narrow focus on providing
A
generous predictable spending flows face little problem, particularly when operating with an
intermediate time horizon. By holding assets that promise low levels of volatility, managers
create a stable portfolio that allows budget planners to forecast payouts with reasonable
certainty. Unfortunately, low risk investment portfolios deliver returns insufficient both to
support substantial distributions and to preserve purchasing power. Exclusive pursuit of stable
support for current operations favors today's generation of scholars over tomorrow's
beneficiaries
A clear direct trade-off exists between preserving assets and supporting operations. To the
extent that managers focus on maintaining purchasing power of endowment assets, substantial
volatility influences the flow of resources delivered to the operating budget. To the extent that
managers emphasize providing a sizable and stable flow of resources to the operating budget,
substantial volatility influences the purchasing power of endowment assets.
Consider two extreme policies to determine the annual spending from an endowment. One
extreme, placing maintenance of asset purchasing power at center stage, requires spending each
year only the real returns generated by the portfolio. Assume a particular year produces
investment returns of 10 percent and inflation of 4 percent. Distributing 6 percent of assets to
the operating units provides substantial support to operations, while reinvesting 4 percent in
the endowment offsets inflation and maintains purchasing power. The following year, in an
environment with 2 percent investment returns and 7 percent inflation, the institution faces a
serious problem. Compensation for inflation requires a 7 percent reinvestment in the
endowment, but the fund generated a return of only 2 percent. The endowment manager
cannot ask the operating units for a 5 percent rebate to maintain portfolio purchasing power.
At best, the institution can declare no distribution, hoping to generate positive real returns in
following years to replenish lost purchasing power and, perhaps, to provide operational
support. From an operating budget perspective, a policy that places year-by-year maintenance
of purchasing power above all else proves unacceptable.
The other policy extreme, pursuing a goal of providing a completely stable flow of resources
to the operating budget, requires spending amounts that increase each year by the amount of
inflation. In the short term, the policy provides perfectly stable inflation-adjusted distributions
from the endowment to the operating budget. While under normal market conditions such a
policy might not harm the endowment, serious damage results when faced with a hostile
financial environment. In a period of high inflation accompanied by bear markets for
investment assets, spending at a level independent of the value of assets creates the potential to
permanently damage the endowment fund.
Spending policies specify the trade-off between protecting endowment assets for
tomorrow's scholars and providing endowment support for today's beneficiaries. Cleverly
crafted rules for determining annual endowment distributions reduce the tension between the
objectives of spending stability and asset preservation, increasing the likelihood of meeting the
needs of both current and future generations.
SPENDING POLICY
Spending policies resolve the tension between the competing goals of preservation of
endowment and stability in spending. Sensible policies cause current-year spending to relate
both to prior-year endowment distributions and to contemporaneous endowment values, with
the former factor providing a core upon which planners can rely and the latter factor
introducing sensitivity to market influences.
Yale's Spending Policy
Based on a structure created by economists James Tobin, William Brainard, Richard Cooper,
and William Nordhaus, Yale's policy relates current year spending both to the previous level of
spending from endowment and to the previous endowment market value. Under Yale's rule,
spending for a given year equals 80 percent of spending in the previous year plus 20 percent of
the long-term spending rate applied to the endowment's market level at the previous fiscal year
end. The resulting figure is brought forward to the current year by using an inflation
adjustment. Since previous levels of spending depend on past endowment market values,
present spending can be expressed in terms of endowment levels going back through time. The
resulting lagged adjustment process averages past endowment levels with exponentially
decreasing weights.
The accompanying chart, Figure 3.1, shows weights applied to endowment values of
previous years (ignoring the inflation adjustment). Multiplying the weights by the endowment
values for the respective years and summing the results determines spending for the current
year. Note that years farther in the past have less influence on the calculation than more recent
years. In contrast, a simple four-year average would apply equal 25 percent weights to each of
the four most recent years.
By reducing the impact on the operating budget of inevitable fluctuations in endowment
value caused by investing in risky assets, spending rules that employ an averaging process
insulate the academic enterprise from unacceptably high year-to-year swings in support.
Because sensible spending policies dampen the consequences of portfolio volatility, portfolio
managers gain the freedom to accept greater investment risk with the expectation of achieving
higher return without exposing the institution to unreasonably large probabilities of
significant budgetary shortfalls.

By doing a particularly effective job of smoothing contributions to the operating budget,
Yale's elegant spending rule contributes an important measure of flexibility to the university'
investment policy. Instead of employing a simple averaging process that unceremoniously
drops the oldest number in favor of the new, as time passes Yale's exponentially declining
weights gradually squeeze out the influence of a particular year's endowment value. The
superior smoothing characteristics reduce the transmission of investment volatility to the
operating budget, allowing pursuit of portfolio strategies promising higher expected returns.
The 80 percent weight on previous year's spending and the 20 percent weight on current
target spending reflect institutional choices regarding the trade-off between spending stability
and purchasing power preservation. Different institutions may well exhibit different
preferences. Moreover, institutional preferences may change over time. In fact, as Yale's
endowment support moved from one-tenth of revenues in the mid 1980s to one-third of
revenues in the mid 2000s, the university opted for greater stability in operating budget
support. By changing the weight on previous year's spending from 70 percent to 80 percent,
Yale reduced the likelihood of a disruptive spending drop (at the expense of greater risk to
purchasing power preservation).
Other Spending Policies
Throughout most of the twentieth century, institutions typically followed a practice of
distributing for current expenditure only income generated in the form of interest, dividends
and rents. Yale, which in 1965 began spending "a prudent portion of the appreciation in
market value," noted two reasons for adopting the new policy
First, it is only by coincidence that Yield will be a correct balance between the present
and the future.... Second, when Yield is the sole measure of what can be spent for
present needs, a situation of annually increasing needs, such as has obtained for many
years and seems likely to continue for many more, forces investment policy to seek to
improve current Yidd. But this, in turn, under market conditions prevailing most of the
time since World War II, could only be done at the loss of some potential Gain
Concerns about "invading principal no doubt underlic the policies of institutions that
base spending on the income generated by a portfolio. As Yale recognized, the distinction
between current income and capital appreciation proves too easily manipulated to provide a
sound foundation for spending policy.
Consider the spending implications of discount, par, and premium bonds with comparable
levels of sensitivity to changes in interest rates, as set forth in Table 3.1. Although these bonds
exhibit remarkably similar investment attributes, spending implications differ dramatically for
an institution pursuing a policy of consuming all current income. The zero coupon bond
provides no current cash flow, the par bond generates a 6 percent yield, and the premium bond
pays out a well-above-market rate of 12 percent. Naturally, holding low coupon bonds leads to
lower current spending and higher future portfolio value, while the opposite consequences
stem from owning high coupon bonds. Fortunately, income-based spending rules determine
spending for far fewer institutions today than in the late 1980s, when nearly one in five of
educational institutions followed a policy of spending portfolio yield.

Today, seven in ten educational institutions determine spending by applying a prespecified
percentage to a moving average of endowment values. Including past endowment values
provides stability, because those past values determined in part the previous year's spending.
Incorporating the current endowment value ensures that spending responds to market
conditions, avoiding potential for damage caused by spending at levels unrelated to
endowment value.
Some institutions spend a prespecified percentage of beginning endowment market value,
thereby transmitting portfolio volatility directly to the operating budget. On the opposite end
of the spectrum, some colleges and universities spend a prespecified percentage of the previous
year's spending potentially threatening endowment purchasing power preservation with
market insensitive spending levels.
A number of institutions decide each year on an appropriate rate, or have no established
rule. This practice, although superficially appealing, fails to instill the financial discipline
provided by a rigorous spending rule. In the absence of a well-defined spending policy,
budgetary balance becomes meaningless. Spend enough to bridge the gap between revenues
and expenses to produce a balanced budget. Spend less to create a deficit. Spend more to
fashion a surplus. Balance, distress, and prosperity rest in the hands of the spending committee.
Fiscal discipline disappears.
Target Spending Rate
The target rate of spending plays a critical role in determining the degree of intergenerational
equity. Spending at levels inconsistent with investment returns either diminishes or enhances
future endowment levels. Too much current spending causes future endowment levels to fall,
benefiting today's scholars; too little current spending causes future endowment levels to rise,
benefiting tomorrow's scholars. Selecting a distribution rate appropriate to the endowment
portfolio balances the demands of today with the responsibilities of tomorrow.
Target spending rates among endowed institutions range from a surprisingly low 0.1
percent to an unsustainably high 15.5 percent. More than 70 percent of institutions employ
target rates between 4.0 percent and 6.0 percent, with about one in six using a 5.0 percent
rate. The appropriate rate of spending depends on the risk and return characteristics of the
investment portfolio, the structure of the spending policy, and the preferences expressed by
trustees regarding the tradcoff between stable budgetary support and asset preservation.
Analysis of investment and spending policies leads to the conclusion that distribution rates
for educational institutions generally exceed the return-producing capacity of endowment
assets. According to a series of simulations conducted by the Yale Investments Office, the
average endowment faces a nearly 20 percent intermediate-term probability of a disruptive
decline in operating budget support. More troubling may be the almost 40 percent long-run
likelihood of losing one-half of endowment purchasing power. High probabilities of
intermediate-term spending volatility and long-term purchasing power decline indicate an
inconsistency between expected portfolio returns and projected spending rates. Institutions
faced with likely failure to meet the central goals of endowment management need to consider
reducing spending levels or increasing expected portfolio returns.
In contrast to the average institution's high probability of failing to achieve endowment
goals, institutions that follow sensible investment and spending policies face much better
probabilities of success. For example, Yale has a long history of implementing well-articulated,
disciplined policies. The university currently projects a 5 percent probability of a disruptive
spending drop (as opposed to nearly 20 percent for the broader universe of institutions) and a
15 percent probability of purchasing power impairment (as opposed to 40 percent for the
broader universe). Superior investment and spending policies lead to dramatically higher
chances for success.
Endowment spending policies balance the competing objectives of providing substantial
stable budgetary flows to benefit today's scholars and preserving portfolio assets to support
tomorrow's academicians. Responsible fiduciaries face the challenging task of evaluating the
ability of investment and spending policies to meet the long-term goal of purchasing power
preservation and the intermediate-term goal of stable operating budget support. Employing
the tools of portfolio construction and spending rules, trustees ultimately select policies based
on preferences regarding the trade-off between the central goals of endowment management.
PURCHASING POWER EVALUATION
Preserving purchasing power requires that each individual gift to endowment forever maintain
its ability to "support a specific set of activities." In aggregate, then, after deducting spending
distributions, endowment assets must grow by the rate of educational inflation and increase by
the amount of new gifts.
Appropriate measurement of inflation allows institutions to assess the continuing ability to
consume a basket of goods and services peculiar to higher education. Since expenses of colleges
and universities differ dramatically from those of individuals, and from those of the economy
as a whole, inflation measures appropriate to individuals (the Consumer Price Index) or the
broad economy (the GNP deflator) work poorly for higher education.
The Higher Education Price Index (HEPI) measures costs specific to educational
institutions. Heavily weighted toward salaries and other personnel costs, over its forty-six-year
history HEPI advanced at a rate approximately 1.4 percent per annum in excess of the GNP
deflator. Lack of productivity gains in education accounts for the greater inflation in academic
costs. A labor-intensive enterprise, teaching cannot be made more efficient without impairing
the process. For example, applying technology by using video terminals to replace in-person
lectures improves productivity in a superficial sense, but diminishes the educational experience.
Likewise, increasing class sizes improves productivity, but undoubtedly reduces quality at the
same time. As long as productivity gains disproportionately accrue to the rest of the economy,
costs for higher education can be expected to grow at a rate higher than the general level of
inflation.
Yale's Endowment Purchasing Power
Figure 3.2 illustrates the Yale endowment's purchasing power from 1950 to 2006. The analysis
begins in 1950, because prior to that date the university lacks clean data on gifts, spending, and
investment performance. Throughout much of the twentieth century, financial statements

recorded only book values of financial assets, providing little information for students of
markets. Unit accounting, which enables institutions to distinguish between various inflows
and outflows, gained wide acceptance only in the early 1970s, causing carlier data to be
disentangled only with great difficulty.
Purchasing power analysis starts with the 1950 endowment value and subsequent inflation
rates. Increasing the 1950 portfolio value by the amount of inflation in each subsequent year
creates a series of purchasing power targets. Since gifts "enlarge the scope of activities
supported by endowment, each year the purchasing power target increases by the amount of
new gifts, which in subsequent years undergo a similar adjustment for inflation.
Note the importance of new gifts to the endowment, with nearly three-quarters of 2006's
targeted value stemming from gifts made since 1950. In other words, in the absence of new
gifts over the preceding fifty-six years, Yale's 2006 endowment would likely total only about
one-quarter of its actual value

A comparison of actual endowment values with targeted levels illustrates the degree of
success in meeting purchasing power goals. Based on the difference between the June 30, 2006
market value of $18.0 billion and the purchasing power goal of $6.7 billion, Yale succeeded
admirably in increasing asset values. Yet the bottom line success includes periods in which the
overall picture appeared far less rosy.
The 1950s witnessed a rough balance between endowment growth and purchasing power
preservation, with a surplus of approximately 17 percent shown by 1959. After keeping pace
through most of the 1960s, the endowment began to suffer as inflationary pressures grew
setting the stage for serious problems to come. During the 1970s, disastrous markets for
financial assets and high inflation caused the endowment to end the decade 56 percent below
its target level. By 1982, Yale's endowment reached a low point, with assets representing only
42 percent of the targeted purchasing power goal. Fortunately, the 1980s bull market reversed
the problems of the 1970s, ultimately allowing the 1994 endowment to achieve the targeted
level of the 1950 endowment inflated and adjusted for gifts. Extraordinary market returns
subsequently boosted the June 30, 2006 endowment to a 170 percent surplus over the target.
Recent dramatic increases in endowment purchasing power cause some to question
whether by accumulating assets, Yale's fiduciaries favor future generations of scholars at the
expense of the current generation. While the question of the appropriate spending level
generates spirited debate, the current increase in assets results from a combination of strong
markets and reasonable spending rules, creating a cushion that will be drawn down in tough
times to come.
Dramatic swings in purchasing power relative to targeted levels come as little surprise to
veteran market observers. In 1982, Yale's endowment registered a nearly 60 percent deficit
versus the desired level. Twenty-four years later, the portfolio shows a 170 percent surplus.
Even though market swings cause institutions to feel alternately poor and rich, sensible
portfolio managers base investment and spending decisions on assumptions regarding long
term capital market characteristics. Evaluating purchasing power preservation requires
appreciation of the positive and negative consequences of market volatility, considered within
the perspective of a distinctly long time frame.
Human nature reacts to unexpectedly handsome investment returns by looking for ways to
consume newfound wealth. Responding to strong markets by increasing spending rates creates
the potential for long-term damage to endowment. First, increases in the rate of spending
following extraordinary investment returns put the institution at risk of consuming part of the
cushion designed to protect against a less robust future. Second, increases in spending soon
become part of an institution's permanent expense base, reducing operational flexibility. If the
rate of spending rises in a boom, an institution facing a bust loses the benefit of a cushion and
suffers the burden of a greater budgetary base.
Target spending rates sit at the center of fiscal discipline, leading responsible fiduciaries to
alter rates with great reluctance. Rather than seeing strong recent performance as an
encouragement to increase payouts, skeptical managers wonder about the sustainability of past
good fortune and prepare for the possibility of a less rewarding future. Only fundamental
improvements in an institution's investment and spending policies justify altering target
spending rates.
Evaluating maintenance of purchasing power requires an extremely long time horizon.
Reacting to a decade of disastrous losses by reducing payout formulas or responding to a
decade of extraordinary returns by increasing distribution rates may harm the academic
enterprise. Bear market-induced cuts in programs and bull market-driven expansions of
offerings needlessly buffet the institution, causing the endowment to fail in its mission of
buffering university operations from financial market volatility. Responsible fiduciaries look
past the inevitable short-run swings in endowment value caused by market gyrations, keeping
attention firmly focused on the long-run preservation of asset purchasing power.
SPENDING SUSTAINABILITY EVALUATION
Stewards of endowment assets strive to provide a substantial, sustainable flow of resources to
support the academic enterprise. In Tobin's words, to "support the same set of activities
throughout time, distributions must grow by at least the rate of inflation for the goods and
services consumed by endowed institutions. When new gifts "enlarge the scope of activities,
distributions from endowment must increase to support and sustain the new activities.
In contrast to the long-term nature of the purchasing power preservation goal, providing a
sustainable flow of support to the operating budget constitutes an intermediate-term objective.
Since large fluctuations in endowment spending flows wreak havoc with a budgetary process
that thrives on stability, endowment managers strive to deliver reasonably predictable
distributions to support operations.
Yale's Endowment Distributions
A spending sustainability analysis, portrayed in Figure 3.3, mirrors the purchasing power
evaluation illustrated earlier. Beginning with 1950 spending from endowment as a base, the
targeted spending levels increase each year by inflation and by the amount of spending from
new gifts. For purposes of analysis, 4.5 percent represents the assumed spending rate on new
gifts, a level consistent with Yale's long-run spending pattern.
Over the fifty-six years covered in the spending analysis, Yale managed to increase or
maintain nominal spending year-in and year-out. Inflation-adjusted spending does not boast
the same unblemished record. After keeping pace with the inflation-adjusted target in the
1950s and 1960s, Yale's spending failed to keep up with the virulent inflation of the 1970s.
Beginning in the mid 1980s, spending flows grew rapidly, posting sizable real gains and closing
the gap between actual distributions and inflation-adjusted goals. In spite of extraordinary
growth in the 1980s and 1990s, not until 1996 did Yale's spending from endowment exceed the
inflation-adjusted target.

The two-year lag between the endowment's recapture of the 1950 gift-adjusted purchasing
power level in 1994 and the spending flow's achievement of the same goal in 1996 stems largely
from the dampening effect of the spending policy's smoothing mechanism. As endowment
values rose rapidly beginning in the early 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, the
averaging process in the spending rule kept endowment distributions from adjusting fully to
the endowment's price appreciation.
More evidence of the impact of the smoothing mechanism comes from the spending level
for 2006. Even though applying the target spending rate of 5.25 percent to the endowment's
$15.2 billion value (as of June 30, 2005) results in a projected distribution of $799 million
(ignoring the inflation adjustment), the actual spending level for fiscal 2006 amounted to only
$618 million. As time passes, the spending rule causes actual payouts to move toward the
targeted level, implying that if Yale were to maintain a $15.2 billion endowment, spending
would approach $799 million within a few years.
While current beneficiaries of endowment distributions sometimes complain about the lag
between endowment growth and spending increases, the smoothing mechanism performs a
necessary function in muting the transmission of volatility in endowment values to spending
flows. Yale's policies dampen volatility effectively, as evidenced by the fact that over the past
fifty-six years the dispersion of year-over-year percentage changes in endowment value (12.4
percent standard deviation) exceeds by a fair margin the dispersion of changes in spending level
(6.9 percent standard deviation). Effective spending rules allow assumption of greater
investment risk, without transmitting the associated volatility to budgetary distributions.
At times, even the most effective set of policies provides little protection against turbulent
markets. The greatest failure in providing stable budgetary support occurred in the 1970s.
Operating in an environment where the rate of inflation exceeded returns on domestic stocks
and bonds, endowment managers faced a grim set of choices. In spite of beginning the decade
with actual spending comfortably ahead of the adjusted 1950 target level, by 1980 actual
spending amounted to less than one-half the inflation-adjusted goal. In the face of hostile
financial market conditions from 1970 to 1980 the university managed only to maintain the
nominal payout, which proved woefully inadequate in the face of the decade's inflation. Even
though nominal spending flows began to rise after 1980, the target level rose faster, causing
actual spending at 1984's nadir to represent only 44 percent of the goal.
Viewed from the perspective of individual, but not independent, five-year periods, Yale
experienced real spending declines of more than 25 percent six times in a succession of
miserable years from 1971 to 1981. Such significant drops represent a failure to provide a stable
flow of resources to support operations.
Providing stable, substantial, sustainable flows of resources to support operations represents
the ultimate test of the effectiveness of endowment investment and spending policies. Even
though at times financial market conditions preclude reasonable satisfaction of endowment
objectives, by fashioning a sensible package of asset management and distribution policies,
investors increase the likelihood of achieving reasonable balance between the competing goals
of protecting endowment assets from inflation-induced crosion and providing high, reliable
levels of current budgetary support.
FOUNDATION INVESTMENT GOALS
Foundations share some characteristics with educational endowments. Along with their
counterparts at colleges and universities, trustees of foundation assets often ignore Ben
Franklin's certainties of life, enjoying favorable tax status and operating with a perpetual
horizon. For many foundations, however, permanency constitutes a choice, not an obligation.
If a foundation pursues a mission with a particular sense of urgency, for example, funding
research to cure a terribly virulent disease, the trustees may decide to expend all available
resources in an attempt to reach the goal with deliberate speed. Even without a time-sensitive
mission, spending at rates designed to extinguish foundation assets constitutes a legitimate
option for trustees.
A number of characteristics separate academic institutions from foundations. College and
university endowment managers control both the management of assets, by determining the
portfolio allocation, and the specification of liabilities, by defining the spending policy. The
lack of constraints on investment and spending strategies provides great flexibility for
fiduciaries, increasing the likelihood of meeting institutional goals.
Foundations exercise complete control over asset-allocation policies, similar to the flexibility
enjoyed by educational institutions. On the spending side, however, foundations must achieve
a minimum payout of five percent of assets to support charitable purposes, or face tax
penalties. The mandated distribution level causes foundations to face an investment problem
materially different from the challenge facing educational endowment managers.
While academic institutions benefit enormously from high levels of endowment
distributions, in the event of a serious disruption in endowment support other revenue sources
play a compensating role in the budgetary base. Endowment distributions generally support
only a modest portion of educational institution operating budgets, with major research
universities relying on endowment payout to fund an average of 12.5 percent of expenditures.7
For most such institutions, a significant decrease in spending from endowment poses difficult
problems, but fails to threaten institutional viability
Foundations rely almost exclusively on investment income to support operations. In 2006,
eight of the ten largest grant-making foundations received essentially 100 percent of total
revenues from investment portfolios. Even though grant programs grow and shrink somewhat
more readily than academic operations, foundations require reasonably stable flows of funds to
avoid disruption, particularly when activities involve multiyear commitments. The great
reliance of foundations on distributions from investment assets calls for structuring portfolios
with lower risk profiles.
Colleges and universities benefit from the generosity of alumni and friends, with gifts
providing an important source of support for academic programs. In difficult times, inflows
from donors serve to dampen shortfalls in endowment support for operations. In prosperous
times, gifts allow educational institutions to expand the scope of their activities. Over time, the
cumulative impact of giving makes an enormous difference to colleges and universities.
The Impact of Gifts
The experience of Harvard, Yale, and the Carnegie Institution over the course of the twentieth
century provides insight into the importance of donor support. The Carnegie Institution of
Washington, one of Andrew Carnegie's many philanthropies, pursues pure, cutting-edge
scientific research in astronomy, plant biology, embryology, global ecology, and earth sciences.
Carnegie established the Institution in 1902 with a $10 million gift, increased the endowment
by a further $2 million in 1907, and added $10 million in 1911. Carnegie's $22 million
endowment nearly equaled Harvard's 1910 fund balance of $23 million and vastly exceeded
Yale's $12 million.
Over the course of nearly a century, the Carnegie Institution endowment more than kept
pace with inflation, with June 30, 2006 assets of $720 million comfortably ahead of the $490
million needed to match the rise in price levels. But the formerly comparable Harvard
endowment, with a June 30, 2006 value of $29.2 billion, and the previously smaller Yale

The two-year lag between the endowment's recapture of the 1950 gift-adjusted purchasing
power level in 1994 and the spending flow's achievement of the same goal in 1996 stems largely
from the dampening effect of the spending policy's smoothing mechanism. As endowment
values rose rapidly beginning in the early 1980s and continuing through the 1990s, the
averaging process in the spending rule kept endowment distributions from adjusting fully to
the endowment's price appreciation.
More evidence of the impact of the smoothing mechanism comes from the spending level
for 2006. Even though applying the target spending rate of 5.25 percent to the endowment's
$15.2 billion value (as of June 30, 2005) results in a projected distribution of $799 million
(ignoring the inflation adjustment), the actual spending level for fiscal 2006 amounted to only
$618 million. As time passes, the spending rule causes actual payouts to move toward the
targeted level, implying that if Yale were to maintain a $15.2 billion endowment, spending
would approach $799 million within a few years.
While current beneficiaries of endowment distributions sometimes complain about the lag
between endowment growth and spending increases, the smoothing mechanism performs a
necessary function in muting the transmission of volatility in endowment values to spending
flows. Yale's policies dampen volatility effectively, as evidenced by the fact that over the past
fifty-six years the dispersion of year-over-year percentage changes in endowment value (12.4
percent standard deviation) exceeds by a fair margin the dispersion of changes in spending level
(6.9 percent standard deviation). Effective spending rules allow assumption of greater
investment risk, without transmitting the associated volatility to budgetary distributions.
At times, even the most effective set of policies provides little protection against turbulent
markets. The greatest failure in providing stable budgetary support occurred in the 1970s.
Operating in an environment where the rate of inflation exceeded returns on domestic stocks
and bonds, endowment managers faced a grim set of choices. In spite of beginning the decade
with actual spending comfortably ahead of the adjusted 1950 target level, by 1980 actual
spending amounted to less than one-half the inflation-adjusted goal. In the face of hostile
financial market conditions from 1970 to 1980 the university managed only to maintain the
nominal payout, which proved woefully inadequate in the face of the decade's inflation. Even
though nominal spending flows began to rise after 1980, the target level rose faster, causing
actual spending at 1984's nadir to represent only 44 percent of the goal.
Viewed from the perspective of individual, but not independent, five-year periods, Yale
experienced real spending declines of more than 25 percent six times in a succession of
miserable years from 1971 to 1981. Such significant drops represent a failure to provide a stable
flow of resources to support operations.
Providing stable, substantial, sustainable flows of resources to support operations represents
the ultimate test of the effectiveness of endowment investment and spending policies. Even
though at times financial market conditions preclude reasonable satisfaction of endowment
objectives, by fashioning a sensible package of asset management and distribution policies,
investors increase the likelihood of achieving reasonable balance between the competing goals
of protecting endowment assets from inflation-induced erosion and providing high, reliable
levels of current budgetary support.
FOUNDATION INVESTMENT GOALS
Foundations share some characteristics with educational endowments. Along with their
counterparts at colleges and universities, trustees of foundation assets often ignore Ben
Franklin's certainties of life, enjoying favorable tax status and operating with a perpetual
horizon. For many foundations, however, permanency constitutes a choice, not an obligation.
If a foundation pursues a mission with a particular sense of urgency, for example, funding
research to cure a terribly virulent disease, the trustees may decide to expend all available
resources in an attempt to reach the goal with deliberate speed. Even without a time-sensitive
mission, spending at rates designed to extinguish foundation assets constitutes a legitimate
option for trustees.
A number of characteristics separate academic institutions from foundations. College and
university endowment managers control both the management of assets, by determining the
portfolio allocation, and the specification of liabilities, by defining the spending policy. The
lack of constraints on investment and spending strategies provides great flexibility for
fiduciaries, increasing the likelihood of meeting institutional goals.
Foundations exercise complete control over asset-allocation policies, similar to the flexibility
enjoyed by educational institutions. On the spending side, however, foundations must achieve
a minimum payout of five percent of assets to support charitable purposes, or face tax
penalties. The mandated distribution level causes foundations to face an investment problem
materially different from the challenge facing educational endowment managers.

In desiring to supply a stable flow of operating income, hoping to exist forever and wishing
to comply with minimum IRS distribution requirements, foundation fiduciaries face a
fundamentally conflicting set of goals. Without a safety net of external sources of support,
foundations feel the impact of poor investment results. Short-term stability in distributions
argues for a less volatile portfolio, while long-run maintenance of purchasing power and high
payout rates point toward a higher risk allocation. Foundations generally opt for lower risk
portfolios, sensibly providing stable flows of resources to support the institutional mission. As
a result, the foundation community spends at rates inconsistent with preservation of capital,
suggesting that in the long run the role of most foundations will diminish as purchasing power
crodes.
In spite of superficial similarities, endowments and foundations differ in important ways,
including the amount of control over spending streams, the degree of programmatic reliance
on portfolio distributions, and the availability of continuing external support. While
endowments and foundations share some important characteristics, dissimilarities between the
two types of funds lead to articulation of meaningfully different purposes and goals. That
investment objectives of such closely related organizations differ so significantly highlights the
importance of careful consideration of the relationship between investment funds and
institutional objectives. Understanding the raison d'etre of a fund and expressing the related
institutional aspirations serve as an important starting point in the fund's management
process.
THE SKEPTICAL VIEWPOINT
In a healthy academic community, controversy abounds. In the case of endowments, debate
generally revolves around intergenerational issues, with some current beneficiaries suggesting
that endowment payout levels provide insufficient support for university operations!
Henry Hansmann, the Augustus E. Lines Professor of Law at Yale Law School, questions
the advisability of any endowment accumulation, raising issues that go far beyond the question
of appropriate payout rates. In an August 2, 1998 New York Times interview, Hansmann
suggests that "a stranger from Mars who looks at private universities would probably say they
are institutions whose business is to run large pools of investment assets and that they run
educational institutions on the side that can expand and contract to act as buffers for
investment pools." Hansmann suggests that trustees pursue a "real objective of accumulating
a large and growing endowment, viewing the educational operations as a constraint to
unfettered financial asset accumulation. Administrators and faculty seek endowments to
provide job security, a light workload, and a pleasant physical environment, while alumni focus
on reputational capital, hoping to bask in the reflected glory of a wealthy educational
institution.
In a paper entitled "Why Do Universities Have Endowments?" Hansmann uses the
experience of the 1960s and 1970s to bolster his argument. He notes the "financial crisis of the
1970s damaged higher education as "private demand declined, government support abruptly
stopped its former upward trajectory, and energy costs increased dramatically."2 Recognizing
that universities found themselves squeezed between costs that were continuing to rise and
income sources that were shrinking, Hansmann observes "little affirmative evidence that
universities have viewed their endowments principally as buffers for their operating budgets. "10
Yale's Endowment Buffer
An analysis of the behavior of Hansmann's own institution belies his claims. His employer,
Yale University, used endowment spending policy to dampen growth in the boom times of the
1960s and to cushion the financial trauma of the 1970s. During the decade of the 1960s, Yale
released an average of 4.4 percent of the endowment to support the academic enterprise.
Strong budgetary results and superior investment performance accompanied endowment
distributions that provided support at levels consistent with long-term sustainability.
In contrast, during the 1970s, spending from endowment averaged 6.3 percent, as Yale
sought to offset, at least in part, the impact of hostile economic forces. Despite following a
policy that released support for the operating budget at unsustainable rates, Yale posted deficits
in every year of the decade. The policy of "leaning against the wind" cost the endowment
dearly, as the purchasing power of assets declined by more than 60 percent between 1968 and
1982, in spite of the infusion of substantial amounts of new gifts.
The historical record indicates that Yale uses endowment assets to shield the operating
budget from disruptive fluctuations in income streams. Sustainable spending rates in the range
of 3.8 percent to 4.4 percent in the 1950s, 1960s, 1980s and 1990s correspond to reasonably
stable operating environments. In contrast, the deficit-plagued 1970s saw spending peak at the
stunning rate of 7.4 percent in 1971. Without extraordinary endowment support in the 1970s,
Yale's operational troubles would have been magnified, perhaps causing long-term damage to
the institution.
Not only does historical experience suggest that Yale employed endowment assets to
insulate academic programs from economic stress, but the very nature of the university's
spending policy places budgetary stability in a prominent place. Each year Yale spends 80
percent of last year's spending adjusted for inflation plus 20 percent of the targeted long-term
spending rate applied to the previous year's endowment market value adjusted for inflation. By
emphasizing budgetary stability, the university expresses a strong preference for using the
endowment to reduce the impact of financial shocks.
Spending Policy Extremes
Examining Yale's spending decisions in the context of policy extremes favoring, on the one
hand, spending stability and, on the other hand, endowment preservation, highlights the
university's substantial bias toward providing reliable support for operations. If universities
treat academic operations as a sideshow to endowment accumulation, spending distributions
would correspond to levels consistent with maintenance of asset purchasing power. In the
extreme case, institutions would distribute only returns in excess of inflation, placing
preservation of investment assets above even a modicum of stability in supporting academic
programs. At the other end of the spectrum, if universities focus exclusively on consistent
payouts from endowment, spending would rise with inflation, tracing a pattern independent
of fluctuations in the market value of endowment assets.
Figure 3.4A illustrates the spending patterns resulting from two extreme spending policies
using market returns from the 1960s and 1970s. The first panel shows the constant flows from
maintaining inflation-adjusted spending, while the second depicts the volatile flows from
maintaining inflation-adjusted endowment values. Note that an exclusive focus on endowment
purchasing power stability fails to allow any distribution to support operations in more than
one-half of the simulated periods.
Figure 3.4B shows the impact of the extreme spending policies on endowment levels.
Pursuing stable spending flows, as illustrated in the first panel, produces enormous volatility in
real endowment values. In contrast, preserving endowment purchasing power promotes
stability in asset values, as depicted by the relatively smooth pattern in the second panel.
Policies designed to provide a constant level of inflation-adjusted support for operations,
illustrated in the top panels of Figures 3.4A and 3.4B, depend on benign financial markets to
operate successfully. Consider the dramatically different results from simulations conducted
using financial data from the 1960s and the 1970s.
The 1960s provided substantial rewards to investors. Stocks returned 7.8 percent per
annum and bonds 3.5 percent in an environment where inflation grew by only 2.5 percent.
Investors pursuing stable spending policies did little damage to endowments, causing a
purchasing power decline of only around 10 percent.
In contrast, economic and financial conditions in the 1970s posed grave threats to endowed
institutions, as high inflation and poor marketable securities returns exacted a terrible toll.
Inflation, consuming 7.4 percent annually, exceeded returns on domestic stocks at 5.9 percent
per annum, bonds at 7.0 percent, and cash at 6.3 percent. Investors found no place to hide.
Simulations show that in 1970, if a traditional portfolio followed a stable spending policy,
more than 60 percent of the purchasing power of a fund evaporated by the end of the decade.

more than 60 percent of the purchasing power of a fund evaporated by the end of the decade.
Policies focused solely on endowment preservation, shown in the middle panels of Figures
3.4A and 3.4B, failed to release any distribution to the operating budget in twelve of the
twenty years between 1960 and 1979, highlighting the impracticality of a single-minded focus
on asset protection. Even in the hospitable environment of the 1960s, investment results
provided no support for current operations in three of ten years. So hostile were the 1970s that
even with only one meaningful distribution to the budget, stable endowment policies failed to
preserve assets, as purchasing power declined by nearly 24 percent.
